The use of spatial analysis for HRSI is well documented in the literature, especially with KDE methods. The proposed SMA, which is based on the Haar wavelet transform, is similar to the KDE method with the additional benefit of allowing the bandwidth to be different at different road segments depending on how homogenous the segments are. Furthermore, the optimal bandwidth at each road segment is determined solely based on the data by minimizing an unbiased estimate of the mean square error for Poisson data called Poisson's unbiased risk estimate (PURE). We compare SMA with the state-of-the-practice crash analysis method and the empirical Bayes (EB) method, in terms of their HRSI ability and their ability to predict future crashes. The results indicate that SMA may outperform EB, at least with the crash data of the entire Virginia interstate network used in this paper. The SMA is computationally fast, does not require any data other than crash counts and their location, and is implemented in an Excel spreadsheet freely available for download. Therefore, it can be used for quick large-scale network screening before a more complex analysis that complements crash counts with other crash explanatory variables, such as traffic volume, is used for selected areas of interest. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

For instance, while the injuries resulting in days away from work were substantially decreased, construction fatalities rose in the previous years. While previous safety fatality research work concentrated on studying how different variables could influence the number of fatalities in the construction industry, there is a lack of research efforts that studied the associations, interdependencies, and critical combinations between the different fatality causes. As such, to solve the critical fatality problem that the construction industry is facing, more advanced management methods should be applied. That said, this paper aims to address this important knowledge gap through a methodology based on data-driven computational algorithms. The data analyzed in this paper is comprised of 100 OSHA national fatal accident case files that are prepared by OSHA compliance officers. First, a reference matrix of 100 case files was constructed based on 60 causes that have shown to be the most pertinent to construction fatalities based on a previous study. Second, the spectral clustering computational algorithm was used to cluster the fatality causes based on the strength of their interconnectivities. Third, the frequent pattern data mining and Apriori algorithms were used to determine the critical combinations and associations of causes that mostly contribute to fatal accidents on construction sites. The findings indicate that the 60 fatality causes could be categorized into five clusters. Thus, the most critical combination of fatality causes was determined within each one of the identified clusters. Also, the findings reflected that while safety accidents could happen due to factors or causes that are individually critical, fatalities on construction sites could also result due to a combination of factors that might not be perceived to be critical on the individual level but rather become critical when combined with other factors. This study adds to the body of knowledge by proposing a data-driven accident causation approach to analyze construction fatality accidents, which adds a different dimension to the traditional analysis of safety accidents by factoring possible associations and combinations between different causes. That said, this paper equips safety professionals with a proactive approach that allows them to take the needed preventive actions to avoid fatalities on construction sites by identifying, in hindsight, the critical combinations and associations of fatality causes. Ultimately, the outcomes of this paper would enhance the safety performance in the construction industry and prevent construction fatalities. © 2021 American Society of Civil Engineers.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

The study proposes a novel approach to include average daily traffic (ADT) and average spot speed (AS) in the accident prediction model for a rural highway.

The findings from the model offer a better estimate of accidents for a multilane divided rural highway. Statistical Models cannot fully reflect the characteristics of each section due to the heterogeneous nature of road accidents, so the association rule mining technique has been used to identify accident spots as it can deal with the heterogeneous nature of accidents. Accident spots have been assessed by correlating various attributes to the severity of the accident (fatal, non-fatal).

There is little systematic understanding of the geography of RTCs and the spatial correlations of RTCs in the Middle-East region, particularly in Oman where RTCs are the leading cause of disability-adjusted life years lost. The overarching goal of this paper is to evaluate the spatial and temporal dimensions, identifying the high risk areas or hot-zones where RTCs are more frequent, using the geocoded data from the Muscat governorate. Data: This study is based on data drawn from the Royal Oman Police (ROP) sample iMAAP database and the National Road Traffic Crash (NRTC) database, managed by the ROP and made available for research use by The Research Council of the Sultanate of Oman. The data covered the period from 1st January 2010 to 2nd November 2014. Only RTCs occurred in Muscat Governorate were included in the study. The study is based on 12,438 registered incidents, however, due to disconnections found on road network, RTCs occurred on disconnected parts were removed and the final analysis considered only 9,357 incidents. Methods: We considered an adjacency network analysis integrating GIS and RTC data using robust estimation techniques including: Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) of both 1-D and 2-D space dimensions, Network-based Nearest Neighbour Distance (Net-NND), Network-based K-Function, Random Forest Algorithm (RF) and spatiotemporal Hot-zone analysis. Findings: The analysis highlight evidence of spatial clustering and recurrence of RTC hot-zones on long roads demarcated by intersections and roundabouts in Muscat. The findings confirm that road intersections elevate the risk of RTCs than other effects attributed to road geometry features. The results from GIS application of NRTC data are validated using the sample data generated by iMAAP database. Conclusion: The findings of this study provide statistical evidence and confirm our research hypothesis that road intersections (roundabouts, crosses and bridges) represent higher risk of causing RTCs than other road geometric features. The results also demonstrate systematic quantitative evidence of spatio-temporal patterns associated with the crash risk over different locations on road networks in Muscat. More importantly, the findings clearly pinpoint the importance and influence of the road and traffic related features in road crash spatial analysis. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :2

This study proposes a Bayesian spatiotemporal interaction (BSTI) approach for crash frequency modeling with an integrated nested Laplace approximation (INLA) method to greatly expedite the Bayesian estimation process. Manhattan, which is the most densely populated urban area of New York City, is selected as the study area. Hexagons are used as the basic geographic units to capture crash, transportation, land use, and demo-economic data from 2013 to 2019. A series of Bayesian models with various spatiotemporal specifications are developed and compared. The BSTI model with Type II interaction, which assumes that the structured temporal random effect interacts with the unstructured spatial random effect is found to outperform the others in terms of goodness-of-fit and the ability to reduce the dependency of residuals. It is also found that the unobserved heterogeneity is mostly attributed to the spatial effects instead of temporal effects. In addition, the BSTI Type II model also yields the lowest predictive error when the last year's data are used as the test set. The proposed BSTI approach can potentially advance safety analytics by achieving high prediction accuracy and computational efficiency while maintaining its interpretability on the effects of contributing factors and the unobserved heterogeneity. © 2021 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 10 May 2021

Chi-squared automatic interaction detection (CHAID) decision tree technique was employed to identify significant risk factors, and the comprehensive influence of the interaction of various factors on roadside accidents was discussed. These factors were then chosen as predictors of probability of roadside accidents in Bayesian network analysis to establish the probabilistic prediction model of roadside accidents. Finally, according to probabilistic prediction results, the identification method for roadside accidents black spots was proposed and verified through tests. Results show that running speed had the greatest effect on the occurrence of roadside accidents, followed by horizontal curve radius, vehicle type, adhesion coefficient, and hard shoulder width. When 80 km/h < v≤100 km/h and 300 m < R≤600 m, with the hard shoulder width not less than 1.5 m, the risk of roadside accidents could be significantly reduced. Compared with cars, trucks were more prone to be involved in roadside accidents, and the hard shoulder width had a more significant impact on the roadside accidents of trucks. When 100 km/h < v≤120 km/h and 300 m < R≤600 m, with the hard shoulder width not less than 2.25 m, the risk of roadside accidents of trucks could be significantly reduced.

It is imperative to explore road sections with a high risk of heavy vehicle accident occurrence by considering the significant consequences of such accidents for road users, despite the low number of heavy vehicles in traffic flow. To address this, this study proposes a method to predict clustering hotspots for heavy vehicle accidents on the basis of three different criteria, namely, heavy vehicle accident cases, the number of heavy vehicles involved, and accident severity index values. Moran’s I spatial autocorrelation was employed to identify the clustering for each criterion, and the Getis–Ord Gi* statistic was applied to estimate the likelihood of risk along the network. This study considers the features of hotspot points at significance levels from 0.10 to 0.01 with a 1355 m buffer radius to create segments for each criterion. The three criteria for hotspots were considered within the overlapped buffer zone. A total of 22 heavy vehicle risk segments (HVRSs) were identified and then ranked by crash rate. Overall, this study demonstrates the application of different criteria to identify accident hotspots involving a specific vehicle type, which could help in prioritizing segments with a high risk of heavy vehicle accidents, as well as providing information for HVRSs for the purpose of developing appropriate countermeasures for the identified accident hotspots. © 2021 by the authors.

The objective of this study was to analyze how accurately do the drivers perceive hazardous degrees of the above four mountainous highway traffic risk factors by making a comparison between subjective risk and objective risk. The results of subjective/perceived risk were based on a self-completion questionnaire survey in a sample of the drivers. 12,866 cases of mountainous highway crashes in Yunnan from 2015 to 2017 were used to establish the “objective/statistical risk” for various risk factors. The results show that as far as differences in hazardous degrees between different mountainous highway traffic risk factors are concerned, the comparisons show high correlations between statistical risk and perceived risk. Both the relative values of statistical risk and perceived risk corresponding to “multi-tunnel sections” are the highest, and the two relative values corresponding to “continuous long downhills” are the lowest. The factors of age, gender, crash experience and the injuries in the crashes of the drivers are proved to have effects on the corresponding perceived risk according to the investigation results. The elderly over 65 years old have much less insufficient perception of the mountainous highway traffic risk factors compared with the objective risk they are facing. There are great differences in statistical and perceived risk between female and male drivers who are between 18 and 24 years old, and the differences in other age groups are not as great as this age group. Drivers recovered from injuries perceived much higher hazardous degrees of all the studied four mountainous highway traffic risk factors than the uninjured drivers in the crashes. The results of this research can provide references for the drivers to modify their driving behaviors to be more appropriate to the circumstances according to the risk they perceive during their driving on the mountainous highways. © 2020, Springer-Verlag London Ltd., part of Springer Nature.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

With the assumption that pupils' school commuting is within the school district, a road exposure model was developed through traffic accident data and road length data to evaluate the pupils' school commuting accident risk. A verification analysis was conducted by taking the central city of Shenzhen as an example. The results show that: the high-risk school districts in the central city of Shenzhen are mainly in the north of Nanshan and Luohu, while the low-risk school districts are mainly distributed in the south-central part of Nanshan and the central part of Futian. The risk assessment model based on the random forest produced 85.93% prediction accuracy. Which shows the performance of the proposed model for the pupils' school commuting accident risk assessment. Primary school density and school district zoning area are two major influencing factors of pupils' school commuting accident risk, which can explain respectively 37.15% and 22.86% of school commuting accident risks.

Escalators are ubiquitous in metro stations, as passengers typically use escalators when entering or leaving a metro station. Thus, escalators have become an accident-prone location. To develop suitable prevention strategies, it is necessary to understand the risk factors that affect the severity of escalator accidents. This study analyzed 967 escalator passenger accidents that occurred in the Guangzhou Metro from 2013 to 2015. The Haddon matrix was used to evaluate the interaction of humans, escalators, and environmental factors before, during, and after accidents. Then, the contributing factors associated with the severity levels were determined based on chi-square tests. Passengers aged 66 years and older are more vulnerable to serious injuries (p < 0.001), and previous health conditions are significantly related to the severity of the passenger’s injuries (p = 0.002). The weather conditions (rainy days) are also significantly related to the severity of escalator accident injuries (p = 0.039), and injured people with head injuries are at greater risk of being severely injured (p < 0.001). The analysis results of these risk factors can provide theoretical support for the metro operators to develop reasonable and effective preventive measures to reduce the escalator risk. © 2021 by the authors.

The medical services aim at locating the accident spots and finding the live status of the person and delivering the medical emergency kit in a short while. Along with manual calculations, the estimated time to reach the drone to the spot from any of the nearest hospitals in both rural and urban areas can be done.

Most accidents occur due to human inattention or wrong decisions, whose factors can be eliminated by autonomous vehicles. However, not all accidents are avoidable through automation. Complying with the law is not always enough, there can be environmental problems (bad weather, road surface, etc.) causing accidents, and other actors (human drivers, pedestrians) making mistakes. These are unexpected situations, and the real-time sensors of vehicles are currently limited in their ability to predict them (a slippery road surface for example) in time, and deliver a programed response to a dangerous situation. This paper presents a method based on the analysis of historical accident records, to find danger zones of public road networks. A further statistical approach is used to find the significant risk factors of these zones, which data can be built into the controlling algorithms of autonomous vehicles, to prepare for these situations and avoid, or at least decrease the seriousness, of the potential incidents. It is concluded that the proposed method can find the black spots of a given road section and give assumptions about the main local risk factors. © 2021 - IOS Press.

This study compared the Chand and Alex severity index with the Equivalent Traffic Accident Number's (ETAN) severity index to understand the spatiotemporal pattern of road traffic crashes in Nigeria. Weighting road crash data could help mitigate road crash risk and improve road safety measures. The weighted crash ratios were calculated based on crash data available between 2012 and 2016. Six factors identified from the literature were used as denominators in deriving these ratios. The sum ratios were ranked and mapped for cross-temporal examination. There was no significant difference between the two methods for assessing accident severity index in this study. Univariate and multivariate spatial analyses were used to detect the hotspot of the weighted crash severity index (WCSI) for the end of the study period. Only the pairwise comparison analysis found a significant difference between the 2012 and 2016 WCSI (p < 0.05). Multivariate regression identified significant associations between youth literacy, speed violation, tyre blowout, and weighted severity index. Geographically weighted regression indicates that their local effects vary across spatial units.

Based on fundamental characteristics of ordinary traffic incidents, this paper develops a perception features system of public opinion consisting of four modules, where the construction methods have been elaborated. First, mining thematic features is realized via the similarity calculation of text vector. Second, based on summarized Chinese expression patterns, time extraction rules, and a five‐layer tree‐like spatial feature thesaurus are established to extract spatiotemporal features. Third, the modeling of the emotional features is achieved by a dictionary‐based analysis model. Fourth, the evolutional features are extracted by the Exponential Generalized Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (EGARCH). In view of the attributes of each module, an integrated framework is built to determine the collaboration relationship of feature indicators. Finally, a case study of Shenzhen public transport has been performed to illustrate the application of proposed methods. Results show that the strong odor in electric buses and a rumor that electric buses have great radiation are two main causes of the decrease in passenger satisfaction in the first quarter of 2017. In contrast, adding new bus lines, increasing service frequency, and guaranteeing the bus‐lane right will improve passenger satisfaction, which is basically consistent with the official report. It should be noticed that the developed framework has been validated in the case study of passenger satisfaction analysis, while it can be extensively replicated in other fields. Furthermore, it is important for stakeholders to grasp the public perception of transportation services, in order to enhance public participation in transportation management and decision‐making. © 2020 by the authors.

However, while the number of traffic crash fatalities in the country has decreased over the past decade, the frequency of cyclists killed or seriously injured has increased. The high rate of serious injuries and fatalities associated with cycling emphasizes the increasing need for mitigating the severity of such crashes. Method: This study conducted an in-depth analysis of cyclist injury severity resulting from single and multiparty bicycle-involved crashes. Detailed information was collected using self-reporting data undertaken in Denmark for a 12-month period between 1 November 2012 and 31 October 2013. Separate multilevel logistic (MLL) regression models were applied to estimate cyclist injury severity for single and multiparty crashes. The goodness-of-fit measures favored the MLL models over the standard logistic models, capturing the intercorrelation among bicycle crashes that occurred in the same geographical area. Results: The results also showed that single bicycle-involved crashes resulted in more serious outcomes when compared to multiparty crashes. For both single and multiparty bicycle crash categories, non-urban areas were associated with more serious injury outcomes. For the single crashes, wet surface condition, autumn and summer seasons, evening and night periods, non-adverse weather conditions, cyclists aged between 45 and 64 years, male sex, riding for the purpose of work or educational activities, and bicycles with light turned-off were associated with severe injuries. For the multiparty crashes, intersections, bicycle paths, non-winter season, not being employed or retired, lower personal car ownership, and race bicycles were directly related to severe injury consequences. Practical Applications: The findings of this study demonstrated that the best way to promote cycling safety is the combination of improving the design and maintenance of cycling facilities, encouraging safe cycling behavior, and intensifying enforcement efforts. © 2021","Export Date: 10 May 2021

In addition, the rear-end crash was often neglected. With regard to the index of each crash type, the safety boundaries of each index, which is the critical value of the index beyond which the corresponding type of crash occurs, were not precise either. To address these issues, this paper presents a method to calculate the average probability of crash occurrence on highway sections based on fault tree analysis (FTA) and an in-depth investigation into vehicle safety boundaries. The proposed method was tested taking an expressway between Bengbu and Nanjing (a section of the G36 expressway) in China as a case study, and the results were validated against the data of crashes occurred on the expressway from December 2005 to February 2017. The results of the proposed method agree better with the crash data than the methods employed in previous studies in terms of goodness of fit and correlation analysis.

Primary data was obtained by direct survey. Meanwhile, secondary data was obtained from various sources related to the number of traffic accidents in Ambon City. The data were analyzed using simple statistical methods and tabulated based on the number of accidents in 2019. The analysis results showed that the high severity of traffic accidents in Ambon City was 91.95% caused by driver behavior factors. Three other factors that cause traffic accidents include drunkenness, carelessness, and drowsiness. The study results showed five black site areas on national roads in Ambon City based on EAN value higher than the UCL value. These locations include roads: Jenderal Sudirman, Pierre Tendean, Wolter Monginsidi, Laksdya Leo Wattimena, and Putuhena. Meanwhile, the Sisingamangaraja road segment has a higher EAN value than the UCL value but not the national road segment (province road segment). Based on these results, several things need to be done to overcome the accident rate. Therefore, national road management agencies and stakeholders, especially those related to the black site area, are advised to: build road medians, add zebra cross-shaped crossing facilities and be equipped with shelters in the road median, complete traffic signs installed with signs that read accident-prone area, build pedestrian protective fences, and traffic management engineering. © 2020, Horizon Research Publishing.

This study aimed to investigate relationships between mountainous highway single-vehicle traffic accident and route familiarity. Route familiarity is defined by the spatial distance between the accident occurring site and driver’s residence in this research. Logistic regression analysis was used to study the relationships. The investigation results show that the odds of finding familiar driver involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle traffic accident is higher: in accidents that occur in the evening and at night; in accidents that occur on the normal sections of the highways; in accidents that occurred when it is sunny; in accidents that the lighting condition is dark without road lights; in the accidents that occurred on the road with road width ≥ 9 m; on the highways that the speed limits are higher than 100 km/h; in the accidents that female drivers are involved. And the factors of evening, night, run-off-road, collision with the fixed object, tunnel, sharp turn, rainy, foggy, dark without light, road width < 7 m, young driver are associated with higher odds of having unfamiliar drivers involved.

Accurate prediction of traffic-related information is necessary for an effective functioning of Intelligent Transportation System (ITS). It is still a challenge for the departments of transportation to choose an appropriate prediction technique for the ITS applications. That is, a user must be able to utilize the disseminated information effectively by the forecasting models. This paper provides a detailed survey of the latest forecasting technologies and contributes to understand the key concept behind the prediction approaches. To provide guidelines to the decision-maker, this paper reviews multifaceted techniques developed by various authors for traffic prediction. We start classifying each technique into four categories namely, Machine Learning (ML), Computational Intelligence (CI), Deep Learning (DL), and hybrid algorithms. Many have conducted survey using model-driven or data-driven methods. We are the first to explore the area of traffic prediction based on the advances in multifaceted techniques proposing algorithmic approaches for key traffic characteristics in the forecasting process. The role of dependent factors in the prediction are analyzed thoroughly. We have analyzed each algorithm chronologically based on various traffic traits. The approaches are summarized based on the rational usage and performance of each technique. The analysis led to several research queries, and the appropriate responses are provided based on our detail survey. Finally, it is confirmed that currently, CI-MLs and DL hybrid techniques outperforms the rest in the field of traffic prediction.

In this paper, traffic accident characteristics are clustered by the optimized density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) clustering method. The 2019 traffic accident data in Wuxi, China is used as a case study. The open map API is used to obtain the longitude and latitude of the accident location as an input for the proposed method. The traditional DBSCAN clustering algorithm normally requires accurate input of the distance threshold and sample number threshold. This paper develops the DBSCAN clustering model with an adaptive search distance threshold and sample number threshold. The comparison results of the proposed algorithm with traditional algorithm show that the optimized algorithm is more intelligent in determining parameters and more accurate in dividing clusters; the recognition of noise points is more reasonable than the traditional algorithm. The applicability of the algorithm in the geographical location clustering for urban road traffic accidents is proved by calculating the model score of the silhouette coefficient in machine learning.

In this paper, we address this gap by proposing a new methodology based on variational autoencoders (VAE) to derive low-dimensional and exploitable parameters of the perspective road geometry. First, road perspective images were generated based on different alignment scenarios. Then, a VAE was built to create a regularized and exploitable latent space from the data. The latent space is a compressed representation of perspective geometry, from which six latent parameters were derived. Without prior expert knowledge, four of the latent parameters were found to represent distinctive attributes of the geometry, such as visual curvature, slope, sight distance, and curve direction. The latent parameters provided quantitative measurements of how the design scheme looks like in perspective view. It was found that a road with low accident rate has low values for codes 4 and 5, high values for code 3, and low variance for codes 3 and 6. The trained VAE model also ensured accurate generation of the perspective images by decoding the latent parameters.

The proposed methodology consists of three steps: (1) improved accident frequency approach to identify the black spots on the freeway network, (2) stochastic programming (SP) model to determine the initial allocation plan sets, and (3) regret-based model in the logarithmical specification to select the most minimal regret one considering the factors of the response time, total cost and demand. The model is applied to the case study of 2014–2016 freeway network in Shandong, China. The results show that the random regret minimization (RRM) model can improve the full-compensation of SP model to a certain degree. RRM in logarithmical specification performs lightly better than random utility maximization (RUM) and RRM in the linear-additive specification in this case. This approach emerges as a valuable tool to help decision makers to allocate resources before traffic accident occurs, with the aim of minimizing the total regret of their decisions.

Nowadays with the help of technologies like GPS, new measures are developed to assess driving risk, inferred from naturalistic driving behaviour of drivers. In this study, two main ways of modelling driver behaviour in naturalistic driving research were discussed and compared to each other. For this purpose, 176 Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) drivers were investigated during their normal driving on Tehran BRT routes. Their speed was continuously recorded by a smart phone app from which was derived deceleration, jerk and celeration measures. Analysis showed that all of the proposed measures had positive correlations with culpable crashes and that one of the jerk variables yielded the highest correlation. Measurements of speed derivatives like jerk and celeration can help to identify dangerous driving styles in public transportation and reduce the number of crashes.

In the existing literature, statistical models are frequently used to quantify the association between crash outcomes and available explanatory variables. However, they are unable to capture the latent spatial heterogeneity accurately. Further, the vast majority of previous studies have focused on detailed spatial analysis of crashes from an aggregated viewpoint without considering the attributes of the built environment and land use. This study first uses geographic information systems (GIS) to examine crash hotspots based on two severity groups, seven prevailing crash causes, and three predominant crash types in the City of Dammam, Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA). GIS-based geographically weighted regression (GWR) analysis technique was then utilized to uncover the spatial relationships of traffic collisions with population densities and relate it to the land use of each neighborhood. Results showed that Fatal and Injury (FI) crashes were mostly located in residential neighborhoods and near public facilities having low to medium population densities on highways with relatively higher speed limits. Distribution of hotspots and GWR-based analysis for crash causes showed that crashes due to “sudden lane deviation” accounted for the highest proportion of crashes that were concentrated mainly in the Central Business District (CBD) of the study area. Similarly, hotspots and GWR analysis for crash types revealed that “collisions between motor vehicles” constitute a significant proportion of the total crashes, with epicenters mostly stationed in high-density residential neighborhoods. The outcomes of this study could provide analysts and practitioners with crucial insights to understand the complex inter-relationships between traffic safety and land use. It can provide useful guidance to policymakers for better planning and effective management strategies to enhance safety at zonal levels. © 2020 by the authors.","Cited By :3

Bayesian count data models have emerged as the workhorse method for producing probabilistic rankings of hazardous sites in road networks. Typically, these methods assume simple linear link function specifications, which, however, limit the predictive power of a model. Furthermore, extensive specification searches are precluded by complex model structures arising from the need to account for unobserved heterogeneity and spatial correlations. Modern machine learning (ML) methods offer ways to automate the specification of the link function. However, these methods do not capture estimation uncertainty, and it is also difficult to incorporate spatial correlations. In light of these gaps in the literature, this paper proposes a new spatial negative binomial model which uses Bayesian additive regression trees to endogenously select the specification of the link function. Posterior inference in the proposed model is made feasible with the help of the Pólya-Gamma data augmentation technique. We test the performance of this new model on a crash count data set from a metropolitan highway network. The empirical results show that the proposed model performs at least as well as a baseline spatial count data model with random parameters in terms of goodness of fit and site ranking ability. © 2020 The Authors","Cited By :1

Route familiarity has been found greatly associated with driver behaviour and traffic safety. This study aimed to investigate and compare the contributory factors that significantly influence the injury severities of the familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes. Based on 3037 cases of mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes from 2015 to 2017, the characteristics related to crash, environment, vehicle and driver are included. Random-effects generalized ordered probit (REGOP) models were applied to model injury severities of familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers that are involved in the single-vehicle crashes on the mountainous highways, given that the single-vehicle crashes had occurred. The results of REGOP models showed that 8 of the studied factors are found to be significantly associated with the injury severities of the familiar drivers, and 10 of the studied factors are found to significantly influence the injury severities of unfamiliar drivers. These research results suggest that there is a large difference of significant factors contributing to the injury severities between familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers. The results shed light on both the similar and different causes of high injury severities for familiar and unfamiliar drivers involved in mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes. These research results can help develop effective countermeasures and proper policies for familiar drivers and unfamiliar drivers targetedly on the mountainous highways and alleviate injury severities of mountainous highway single-vehicle crashes to some extent. Based on the results of this study, some potential countermeasures can be proposed to minimize the risk of single-vehicle crashes on different mountainous highways, including tourism highways with a large number of unfamiliar drivers and other normal mountainous highways with more familiar drivers. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :2

The weighted pooled volume coefficient for all crashes and all levels of crash severity (excluding fatal crashes) is 0.875. The most important moderator variable is crash type. Pooled volume coefficients are systematically greater for multi vehicle crashes (1.210) than for single vehicle crashes (0.552). Regarding crash severity, the results indicate that volume coefficients are smaller for more fatal crashes (0.777 for all fatal crashes) than for injury crashes but no systematic differences were found between volume coefficients for injury and property-damage-only crashes. At higher levels of volume and on divided roads, volume coefficients tend to be greater than at lower levels of volume and on undivided roads. This is consistent with the finding that freeways on average have greater volume coefficients than other types of road and that two-lane roads are the road type with the smallest average volume coefficients. The results indicate that results from crash prediction models are likely to be more precise when crashes are disaggregated by crash type, crash severity, and road type. Disaggregating models by volume level and distinguishing between divided and undivided roads may also improve the precision of the results. The results indicate further that crash prediction models may be misleading if they are used to predict crash numbers on roads that differ from those that were used for model development with respect to composition of crash types, share of fatal or serious injury crashes, road types, and volume levels. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :1

The proposed layer contains two algorithms that work in sequence: the infrastructure detection algorithm and the driver classification algorithm, respectively. The infrastructure detection algorithm aims to identify intersection-related driving when the driver adjusts his or her behavior due to the presence of an intersection ahead. Then, the driver classification algorithm categorizes drivers into cautious, normal, and aggressive at both locations. Data from 64 drivers in a Naturalistic Driving Study was used to prove the concept of the proposed layer. Several behavioral measures were extracted, including following distance, relative speed, headway, acceleration, time-to-collision, and jerk. These behavioral measures were then used to train the algorithms in the context identification layer. The results of both algorithms supported the concept of the proposed layer. These results have implications related to driver behaviors including i) the intersection-related driving behavior can be detected, ii) the drivers tend to be relatively aggressive at intersections when compared to segments, and iii) the driver classification, which ignores the driver's relative location to intersections, were more likely to misclassify drivers as aggressive when they were in high intersection density areas such as downtown cores. The findings of this study emphasized the importance of context-aware DAS architecture that acknowledges and integrates the variation in driver behavior due to both a change in the surrounding environment and drivers’ individual needs. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Export Date: 10 May 2021

Meanwhile, logistic regression analyses are applied to determine the correlations between road type, traffic flow type, and traffic accidents. It shows that road type and traffic flow type have no significant interactive impacts on accidents, while road type has a significant impact on the number of accidents.

The research of road accident prediction aims to respond to the challenge of offer tools to generate a more secure mobility environment, and ultimately, save lives. This paper aims to provide an overview of the state of the art in the prediction of road accidents through machine learning algorithms and advanced techniques for analyzing information, such as convolutional neural networks and long short-term memory networks, among other deep learning architectures. Furthermore, in this article, a compendium and study of the most used data sources for the road accident forecast is made. And a classification is proposed according to its origin and characteristics, such as open data, measurement technologies, onboard equipment and social media data. For the analysis of the information, the different algorithms employed to make predictions about road accidents are listed and compared, as well as their applicability depending on the types of data being analyzed, along with the results obtained and their ease of interpretation and analysis. The best results reported by the authors are obtained when two or more analytic techniques are combined, in such a way that analysis of the obtained results is strengthened. Among the future challenges in road traffic forecasting lies the enhancement of the scope of the proposed models and predictions by the incorporation of heterogeneous data sources, that include geo spatial data, information from traffic volume, traffic statistics, video, sound, text and sentiment from social media, that many authors concur that can improve the precision and accuracy of the analysis and predictions. © 2020 The Authors","Cited By :3

This regency is crossed by a national road across Sumatra that connects provinces on the island of Sumatra. This has led to an increase in traffic accidents in this region. The number of accidents reached 114 accidents in the official police report for 2018. This study discusses locations that have a high frequency of accidents and represents them in the form of spatial data. The data used is based on the official report of the accident from Labuhanbatu Resort Police in 2018 which consists of 3 attributes namely, accident id, time of the accident, and location of the accident. The method used is to create a density map to calculate complexity in certain areas using Quantum GIS. This study uses the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method with a search bandwidth in an area of 300 meters. The results of the study are accident heat maps for the study area and related to the inputted attributes. The highest heatmap in the Bilah Hilir and Panai Tengah sub-districts with 25 attributes and 24 accidents included. The use of heatmap can produce spatial data that is easier to understand because it's clustering from the same area.

Initially, a spatial database of accident features and locations was prepared. Between 2008 and 2015, 14,317 traffic accidents were identified. The hotspot and kernel density estimation (KDE) methods, which were developed to determine the spatial densities in geographical information systems, are commonly used to successfully detect high traffic-accident-density areas. In this study, z scores determined by hotspot analysis were used as weight value for weighted KDE. These areas were obtained separately for each year, and an accident time series was created. The spatiotemporal changes to these areas occurring between 2008 and 2015 were determined.

The data used in most of the existing assessment methods comes from statistical yearbooks or field survey sampling. These statistics are generally based on administrative areas and are difficult to support a fine-grained evaluation model. In response to these problems, the evaluation method proposed in this paper is based on the query statistics of the geographic grid of the target area, which are more accurate and efficient. Based on the query statistics of hot words in the geographic grids, this paper adopts the maximum likelihood estimation method to estimate the population in the grid region. Then, according to the statistical yearbook data of Hunan province, the estimated number and actual number of hospitals in each grid are analyzed and compared to measure the fairness of health resource allocation in the target region. Experiments show that the geographical grid population assessment based on hot words is more accurate and close to the actual value. The estimated average error is only about 17.8 percent.

However, this is challenging in urban regions of developing countries, where rapid city growth forces high-speed intercity roads to serve as urban arterials, along which traditional 50 km/h limit is not practically possible. To lower the speed variation (and provide mobility), speed limit increase is allowed as high as 82 km/h as in the case of urban arterials in Turkey. To understand the real impact of such controversial countermeasures, which is the main scope of this study, spatiotemporal distribution of accident hotspots along urban arterials are analyzed in GIS using nearest neighbor hierarchical (NNH) clustering; changes between 3 years before and after periods are evaluated using as hit rate (HR), predictive accuracy index (PAI), and recapture rate index (RRI) indices. For a case study of 7 urban arterials in Ankara, NNH analysis (with nmin= 5 and dmax= 250 m) resulted in 94 clusters in the before period, while there were 101 clusters in the after period; and decreased PAI values in the after case showed more accidents in the clusters, demonstrated no real improvement by speed limit increase. Application of safe system approach in the critical hotspots also showed that speed limit increase on the study corridors in Ankara was against the safe limits suggested by UNECE based on possibility of certain accident types. © 2020, Saudi Society for Geosciences.","Cited By :1

These highway sections were divided into five levels based on their evaluated level of risk. With the effects of multiple factors and the characteristics of uncertainty, mathematical statistics and fuzzy expert systems (FESs) were used to determine the factors contributing to hazardous sections of mountainous highways. The membership functions and fuzzy rule base were decided according to accident data and expert experience and a method for identifying hazardous sections based on the expert systems was established. The risk values of another 35 horizontally curved sections were obtained by this method and good results were achieved using the method to identify hazardous sections. The results showed that hazardous section classification is greatly affected by the horizontal radius, grade and declination angle of the horizontal curve.

We assume that different spatial strategies used to represent, explore and move through the environment may predict risky driving behaviour. Here, we investigated spatial strategies and driving behaviour in 167 college students (86 women) using the following tests: the Spatial Cognitive Style Test, aimed at assessing spatial strategies characterized by different degrees of spatial competences (ranging from landmark, route to survey); the Manchester Driver Behavior Questionnaire, aimed at assessing errors, lapses, ordinary and aggressive Highway Code violations; the Attitude toward Road Safety Issues, aimed at assessing road safety attitudes related to driving. A series of regression analysis showed that spatial strategy used by drivers predicted the number of errors, lapses, ordinary and aggressive violations, as well as the number of road-safety behaviours. In conclusion, our results suggest that drivers preferring a survey strategy are much more able to make correct spatial decisions. Specifically, they are more confident about their spatial competence that in turn makes them less aggressive towards other drivers.

Road Traffic Accident (RTA) data in 3 years (2015 − 2017) in Hanoi, Vietnam were used to analyze and test this approach. Firstly, the RTA data were divided into four seasons in accordance with Hanoi’s weather conditions and the time intervals such as the daytime, nighttime, or peak hours. Then, the Kernel Density Estimation (KDE) method was applied to analyze hotspots according to the time intervals and seasons. Finally, the results were presented by using the comap technique. This study considered both analyses with and without SI. The accident SI measures the seriousness of an accident. The approach method is to give higher weights to the more serious accidents, but not with the extremely high values calculated on a direct rate to the accident expenditures. The results showed that both analyses determined the relatively similar hotspots, but the rankings of some hotspots were quite different due to the integration of SI. It is better to take into account SI in determining RTA hotspots because the gained results are more precise and the rankings of hotspots are more accurate. From there, the traffic authorities can easily understand the causes behind each accident and provide reasonable solutions to solve the most dangerous hotspots in case of limited budget and resources appropriately.

This concept is also known as “self-explaining roads” (SERs). Previous studies have demonstrated that understanding how road characteristics affect drivers’ speed choices is the key to SERs. Thus, in order to reduce traffic casualties via engineering methods, this study aimed to establish a speed decision model based on visual road information and to propose an innovative method of SER design. It was assumed that driving speed is determined by road geometry and modified by the environment. Lane fitting and image semantic segmentation techniques were used to extract road features. Field experiments were conducted in Tibet, China, and 1375 typical road scenarios were picked out. By controlling variables, the driving speed stimulated by each piece of information was evaluated. Prediction models for geometry-determined speed and environment-modified speed were built using the random forest algorithm and convolutional neural network. Results showed that the curvature of the right boundary in “near scene” and “middle scene”, and the density of roadside greenery and residences play an important role in regulating driving speed. The findings of this research could provide qualitative and quantitative suggestions for the optimization of road design that would guide drivers to choose more reasonable driving speeds. © 2020 by the authors.

Five sites from the urban expressway in Xi'an were selected to explore the TTC distribution. An unmanned aerial vehicle and a camera were used to collect traffic flow data for 20 min at each site. The parameters, including speed, deceleration rate, truck percentage, traffic volume, and vehicle trajectories, were extracted from video images. The TTCs were calculated for each vehicle. The Gaussian mixture model (GMM) was proposed to predict the TTC probability density functions (PDFs) and cumulative density functions (CDFs) for five sites. The Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test indicated that the samples followed the estimated GMM distribution. The relationship between the crash risk level and influencing factors was studied by an ordinal logistic regression model and a naive Bayesian model. The results showed that the naive Bayesian model had an accuracy of 86.71%, while the ordinal logistic regression model had an accuracy of 84.81%. The naive Bayesian model outperformed the ordinal logistic regression model, and it could be applied to the real-time collision warning system. © 2020 by the authors.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

This study concentrated on introducing a quantitative comparison of sites according to four crash-based methods suggested in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM). Archived crash data for three years are obtained to conduct a comparison course. As a case study, the analysis and measure of safety for 9 four-leg signalized intersections in Baghdad city have been done independently using Empirical Bayes method (EB-method), observed Crash Frequency (CF), Crash Rate (CR) and Empirical Bayes Adjustment (EB-adj.) as safety performance measures in HSM. In this paper the EB-method is used as a benchmark for comparison. The safety measures are evaluated through rank correlation analysis while hazard location identification results are compared through the use of values rank-based mean absolute error. Quantitative evaluation tests showed that each of EB-adj and observed CF correlated well with EB-method while CR method exhibited poor performance in comparison with EB-method and was the worst in hazard location identification.

The Poisson-Tweedie distribution offers a unified framework to model overdispersed, underdispersed, zero-inflated, spatial, and longitudinal count data, as well as multiple response variables of similar or mixed types. The form of its variance function is simple, and can be specified as the mean added to the product of dispersion and mean raised to the power P. The flexibility of the Poisson-Tweedie distribution lies in the domain of P, which includes positive real number values. Special cases of the Poisson-Tweedie distribution models include the linear form of the negative binomial (NB1) model with P equal to 1.0, the geometric Poisson (GeoP) model with P equal to 1.5, the quadratic form of the negative binomial (NB2) model with P equal to 2.0, and the Poisson Inverse Gaussian (PIG) model with P equal to 3.0. A series of models were developed in this study using the Poisson-Tweedie distribution without any restrictions on the value of the power parameter as well as with specific values of the power parameter representing NB1, GeoP, NB2, and PIG models. The effects of fixed and varying dispersion parameters (i.e., dispersion as a function of covariates) on the variance and expected crash frequency estimates were also examined. Three years (2012–2014) of crash data from urban three-leg stop-controlled intersections and urban four-leg signalized intersections in the state of Florida were used to develop the models. The Poisson-Tweedie models or the GeoP models were found to perform better when the dispersion parameter was constant or fixed. With the varying dispersion parameter, the NB2 and PIG models were found to perform better, with both performing equally well. Also, the fixed dispersion parameter values were found to be smaller in the models with a higher value of the power parameter. The variation across the models in their estimates of weight factor, expected crash frequency, and potential for safety improvement of hazardous sites based on the empirical Bayes method was also discussed. © 2020 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :3

The Bike Safety Index is calculated from bike network coverage, continuity, and complexity as well as signal density and recreational density.

The calculation of the Dynamic Site Length (DSL) method is based on Dynamic Programming, and it is shown to be effective to find the close-to-optimal solution with computationally feasible complexity. The screening method has been demonstrated using historical crash data from extended freeway routes in San Francisco, California. Using the Empirical Bayesian (EB) estimate as a safety measure, we compare the performance of the proposed DSL method with other conventional screening methods, Sliding Window (SW) and Continuous Risk Profile (CRP), in terms of their optimal objective value (i.e., performance of detecting sites under the highest risk). Moreover, their spatio-temporal consistency is compared through the site and method consistency tests. Findings show that DSL can outperform SW and CRP in investigating more hotspots under the same amount of resources allocated to DES by pinpointing hotspot locations with greater accuracy and showing improved spatio-temporal consistency. © 2019","Cited By :2

Because few, low-severity crashes are available, safety analyses of naturalistic data often rely on near crashes. Nevertheless, the relation between near crashes and crashes is still unknown, and the debate on whether it is legitimate to use near crashes as a proxy for crashes is still open. This paper exemplifies a methodology that combines crashes from a crash database and near crashes from naturalistic studies to explore their potential relation. Using exposure to attribute a risk level to individual crashes and near crashes depending on their temporal and spatial distribution, this methodology proposes an alternative to blackspots for crash analysis and compares crash risk with near-crash risk. The novelty of this methodology is to use exposure with high time and space resolution to estimate the risk for specific crashes and near crashes. © 2019, © 2019 The Author(s).

While the concept of reliability, including travel time reliability model and its evaluation indicators have been extensively studied in ground transportation, they are relatively very scarce in air transportation. Flight block time reliability not only exert a strong influence on passenger behavior but also greatly affect aerodromes, airlines and air traffic management, thus affecting the entire air transportation. This paper proposes a methodology for evaluating the flight block time under different delay time windows. We applied the Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise (DBSCAN) method to set windows which reflects different delays. We proposed a probabilistic model of flight block time based on a series system. A case study is performed to compare flight block time, flight air time, flight taxi-in time, and flight taxi-out time at different time reliability metrics with different delays. In particular, we found the best fit for each flight time segment of three delay time windows among nine well-known distribution functions to calculate the flight block time reliability indexes. Based on our analysis, we find that the reliability of delay time window 3 from 22:20- 23:00 to be relatively less compared to the other delay time windows.

For a safer and more sustainable road transportation system, adequate protective countermeasures need to be introduced for this user category. However, related (and limited) resources restrict any safety improvements to certain high-risk sites with elevated rates of road traffic collisions. This study reports the results of a spatial distribution analysis of traffic collisions involving VRU in Turin over the period 2006-2016. The traffic road collisions database from the Italian National Institute of Statistics (ISTAT) was used for this purpose. Crash data were firstly geo-localized, and then analyzed using Geographic Information System technologies. A cluster analysis and a Kernel Density estimation were used to build spatial patterns of crashes involving VRU. Hazardous sites were identified on a metropolitan scale. Incorrect estimates of the actual collision frequency, which are typical of studies conducted over short periods, were avoided by considering only those sites where collision rates remained significantly high throughout the entire observation period (eleven years). The results show that clusters occur at intersections, many of which are located along corridors affected by heavy traffic flows and wide cross-sections.

Sri Racha district in Chon Buri province was selected as the study area for this research. The accident data of 2012-2017 was collected from the Road Accident Data Center (ThaiRSC). The spatiotemporal pattern of road accidents was clustered into various scales: accidents occurring on weekdays, weekends, daytime, nighttime and those involving fatality and injury. Spatial statistical methods, kernel density estimation ( KDE), and Ripley’ s K-function in geographic information system (GIS) were applied to identify patterns and the distribution of road accidents. The findings showed that a high density of road accidents was found in three main areas: Sri Racha municipality, Laem Chabang City municipality and Bowin subdistrict. The spatial distribution of all types of road accidents was clustered at various distances. Several agencies can use the results for planning and managing road accident reduction strategies. Furthermore, GIS and spatial statistical methods are effective tools that are quite widely used for accident analysis. © 2019, King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang.

Speed prediction model serves as the most efficient method to obtain the data of driving speed. Current speed prediction models mostly focus on operating speed, which is hard to reveal the overall condition of driving speed on the road section. Meanwhile, the models were mostly developed based on the regression method, which is inconsistent with natural driving process. Recurrent neural network (RNN) is a distinctive type of deep learning method to capture the temporary dependency in behavioral research. The aim of this paper is to apply the deep learning method to predict the general condition of driving speed in consideration of the road geometry and the temporal evolutions. 3D mobile mapping was applied to obtain road geometry information with high precision, and driving simulation experiment was then conducted with the help of the road geometry data. Driving speed was characterized by the bimodal Gauss mixture model. RNN and its variants including long short-term memory (LSTM) and RNN and gated recurrent units (GRUs) were utilized to predict speed distribution in a spatial-temporal dimension with KL divergence being the loss function. The result proved the applicability of the model in speed distribution prediction of freight vehicles, while LSTM holds the best performance with the length of input sequence being 400 m. The result can be related to the threshold of drivers' information processing on mountainous freeway. Multiple linear regression models were constructed to be a contrast with the LSTM model, and the results showed that LSTM was superior to regression models in terms of the model accuracy and interpretability of the driving process and the formation of vehicle speed. This study may help to understand speed change behavior of freight vehicles on mountainous freeways, while providing the feasible method for safety evaluation or network efficiency analysis. © 2020 Yuren Chen et al.","Cited By :2

The objective of this paper is to validate forest fire hotspots identified by two statistical-based and one non-statistical-based GIS hotspot analysis methods, namely Getis-Ord Gi*, Anselin Local Moran's I and Kernel Density Estimation (KDE), in a study area. The three hotspot analyses were validated by evaluating the spatial interference between the identified forest fire hotspots by each method and existing forest fire contributory factors. The study found that KDE resulted in better spatial matching of forest fire hotspots and forest fire contributory factors, compared to Getis-Ord Gi*.

While this extent of progress has led to various advantages, road accidents have also become one of the main causes of concerns due to both, life and economic losses. The WHO has predicted that road accidents will be one of the biggest killers in India by 2020. This calls for assessment of these accidents by identifying and analyzing the causes that are responsible for their occurrence, and recommending various remedial measures to mitigate the accidents. This study aims to look at this problem by utilizing an accident analysis and modeling tool to arrive upon the comprehensive understanding of accidents and formulation of remedial measures. The study demonstrates the application of VISUM Safety tool and measures its effectiveness using statistical methods. The tool presents the accident data in a way that helps in analyzing and understanding the data, by bringing the otherwise concealed factors to the fore, through its visual graphics. The data was collected for different road stretches in the Sadashivanagar region of Bangalore, which is one of the major black spot locations of the city. The accident prediction models are based on these data points collected from this whole region across junctions and road links. It is envisaged that the study will help propose effective course of action that needs to be adopted by the transportation planners in designing a safer road-user environment. As tabular and statistical representation takes viewers longer to comprehend and read due to their structure, tool-generated reports would be of great significance when presented to local governing authorities. It can be referred to identify factors affecting road safety in relation to ‘black spot’ identification and network safety analysis. The concluding statements in the form of vivid and self-explanatory visual graphics would certainly have an upper hand on tabular and statistical representation and will help the viewer connect the dots effortlessly. © 2020, Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

Firstly, hotspots were identified by applying a GIS-based KDE algorithm. Secondly, the hotspot clusters were evaluated in terms of statistical significance by applying the Moran’s I statistic indices. Finally, hotspots were arranged according to their significance. TA data in the (2015–2017) period in Hanoi, Vietnam were applied to test this approach. Importantly, the study proposed a validation process for the results by applying the Gi* statistics method to validate the (H-H) clusters and the EPDO method to validate the ranking of hotspots. The results showed that this integration overcame the drawbacks of the KDE method. The statistical test process of clusters helped to hinder the occurrence of too many clusters that were determined by the KDE method because they were not really dangerous. This approach was helpful and precise in identifying TA hotspots with the statistical meaning.

In this context, four-lane divided carriageway connecting Gurugram with Faridabad and thus spanning a length of km 24.3 has been selected as the study stretch. For the above road corridor, traffic safety measures have been carried out based on the observed road crash data using different types of statistical approaches, mainly before–after comparisons of observed data, and forecasting studies based on road safety audits. This is primarily carried out on the assumption that there is direct correlation between the degree of safety on a road and the number of road crashes that occur there. Even though road crash data is a true representation of safety, its use in safety studies has many limitations. There are many other techniques which can be used for traffic safety evaluation in advance before the accidents occurs. These techniques are called traffic surrogate models. The word ‘surrogate’ means ‘substitute’ or ‘replacement’ which implies that by using surrogate measures to determine traffic safety as another factor to represent traffic safety.

The proposed technique is derived based on the hypothesis that the characteristics of the surroundings of the road have an effect on the safety level of a particular spot, and is the first black spot classification technique that is fully environment-aware. Assessing four street view images around each spot, a distance-aware pixel accumulation is developed to extract information about the objects surrounding the road from a semantically segmented image. The accumulated vectors are then used to train fully-connected neural networks to identify black spots. Performance evaluations are conducted with street view images in Thailand, which represent a challenging scenario of analyzing road characteristics in developing countries, with one of the highest road traffic fatality rates and limited historical accident records. Comparisons between our proposed technique and previously proposed techniques are also provided. Experiments show that our proposed technique succeeds in classifying black and safe spots in Thailand with an accuracy of 69.91%, where 75.86% of the black spots are identified correctly.

The WHO Global Status Report on Road Safety suggests that the annual fatality rate (per 100,000 people) due to RTCs in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) has increased from 17.4 to 27.4 over the last decade, which is an alarming situation. This paper presents an overview of RTCs in the Eastern Province, KSA, from 2009 to 2016. Key descriptive statistics for spatial and temporal distribution of crashes are presented. Statistics from the present study suggest that the year 2012 witnessed the highest number of crashes, and that the region Al-Ahsa had a significantly higher proportion of total crashes. It was concluded that the fatality rate for the province was 25.6, and the mean accident to injury ratio was 8:4. These numbers are substantially higher compared to developed countries and the neighboring Gulf states. Spatial distribution of crashes indicated that a large proportion of severe crashes occurred outside the city centers along urban highways. Logistic regression models were developed to predict crash severity. Model estimation analysis revealed that crash severity can be attributed to several significant factors including driver attributes (such as sleep, distraction, overspeeding), crash characteristics (such as sudden deviation from the lane, or collisions with other moving vehicles, road fences, pedestrians, or motorcyclists), and rainy weather conditions. After critical analysis of existing safety and infrastructure situations, various suitable crash prevention and mitigation strategies, for example, traffic enforcement, traffic calming measures, safety education programs, and coordination of key stakeholders, have been proposed. © 2019 by the authors.

This is impacting on all aspects of society: house prices, health, multi-ethnic society, and transport amongst many others. Social media data is a hugely popular data source for research in many domains from understanding urban environments to predicting election results. In this paper we present an approach to identify commuter travel patterns and calculate the average travel time of commuters around Melbourne using social media data from Twitter, Instagram, FourSquare and Flickr. At present there is no other technology or system that captures this information other than by randomly sampling subsets of the population. To achieve this, the social media data was transformed into travel vectors and subsequently filtered in order to facilitate analysis and reduce noise in the data. Travel patterns were then learned using K-means clustering and use of force-directed graphing techniques. Travel pattern identification was based on social media user movement between suburb boundaries in the city of Melbourne. The calculated travel time was compared to the expected travel time by train. A web based platform was developed to allow analysis of the results. The results show that social media can indeed be used to better understand commuting behaviours, although it is highly dependent on the amount of data and especially geo-coded data from individual users. © 2019 Association for Computing Machinery.","Cited By :1

Not only do injuries lead to financial damage, but they can end in life-threats. Several people have been killed in fatal accidents in many ways. It is predicted that in the next five years there will be more cars on the road. Accidents will also increase as the number of vehicles on the road increases. Traffic accidents are becoming more prevalent, and a safer way to avoid them is to be sought. Dubai, like every other state, often faces accident and road congestion problems. The Smart City initiative in Dubai was designed to help urban residents to experience their daily life through software. Improvements in traffic networks are also significant. Forecasting incidents can minimise the pattern of triggering reasons/activities. This is why a logistic regression method has been built in this paper to forecast injuries.

We collected and (re-)analyzed evidence in order to conduct cost-benefit analyses (CBAs) for 29 road safety measures. The information on crash costs was based on data from a survey in European countries. We applied a systematic procedure including corrections for inflation and Purchasing Power Parity in order to express all the monetary information in the same units (EUR, 2015). Cost-benefit analyses were done for measures with favorable estimated effects on road safety and for which relevant information on costs could be found. Results were assessed in terms of benefit-to-cost ratios and net present value. In order to account for some uncertainties, we carried out sensitivity analyses based on varying assumptions for costs of measures and measure effectiveness. Moreover we defined some combinations used as best case and worst case scenarios. In the best estimate scenario, 25 measures turn out to be cost-effective. 4 measures (road lighting, automatic barriers installation, area wide traffic calming and mandatory eyesight tests) are not cost-effective according to this scenario. In total, 14 measures remain cost-effective throughout all scenarios, whereas 10 other measures switch from cost-effective in the best case scenario to not cost-effective in the worst case scenario. For three measures insufficient information is available to calculate all scenarios. Two measures (automatic barriers installation and area wide traffic calming) even in the best case do not become cost-effective. Inherent uncertainties tend to be present in the underlying data on costs of measures, effects and target groups.

Several hotspot identification methods have been developed in the literature; however, there are often large differences between the spatial distributions of hotspots obtained by these methods, and spatial weights such as free flow travel times and congested flow travel times have not been fully examined as alternatives to the weight of distance. This paper compares the following commonly implemented network-based hotspot detection methods: Getis-Ord Gi*, Local Moran's I, KLINCS (K-function local indicators of network-constrained clusters), and KLINCS-IC (Inverse Cost) in order to provide insight into understanding the similarities and differences between selected hotspot detection methods when used with different spatial weights. This assessment is performed through using different spatial weights as part of the statistical analysis and comparing them to a prediction accuracy index. Moreover, a sensitivity analysis was conducted based on alternative spatial weights and different parameters to test the effect of bandwidth on the identified hotspots. The findings on the success of alternative spatial weights has a potential to improve the accuracy of the hotspot detection. Results indicate distinct differences in the spatial distributions of hotspots obtained through the considered methods that are based on alternative spatial weights. An interesting finding is that all alternative approaches (spatial weights and bandwidths) cluster when certain bandwidth values are exceeded. From a practical perspective, the CPAI results show that using network-constrained Local Moran's I statistics with a distance-based spatial weights may provide the most feasible approach while implementing safety-focused efforts. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :5

While traditional methods of spatial clustering of car accidents mostly rely on the two dimensional assumption, many spatial events defy this assumption. For instance, car accidents are constrained by the road network and rely on the one dimensional assumption of street network. The aim of this study is to detect and statistically prioritize the car accident-prone segments of an urban road network by a network-based point pattern analysis. The first step involves estimating the density of car accidents in the one dimensional space of the road network using the network kernel density estimation (NKDE) method with equal-split continuous and discontinuous kernel functions. In the second step, due to the lack of statistical prioritization of the accident-prone segments with NKDE method, the output of the NKDE method is integrated with network-constrained Getis-Ord Gi∗ statistics to measure and compare the accident-prone segments based on the statistical parameter of Z-Score. The integration of these two methods can improve identification of accident-prone segments which is effective in the enhancing of urban safety and sustainability. These methods were tested using the data of damage car accidents in Tehran District 3 during 2013-2017.

In the frame of smart cities, active modes are expected to be promoted to improve living conditions. To achieve this goal, it is necessary to reduce the number of vulnerable road users (VRUs) injuries. Considering injury severity levels from crashes involving VRUs, this article seeks spatial and temporal patterns between cities and presents a model to predict the likelihood of VRUs to be involved in a crash. Kernel Density Estimation was applied to identify blackspots based on injury severity levels. A Multinomial Logistic Regression model was developed to identify statistically significant variables to predict the occurrence of these crashes.

Using a frame of raster representation, each factor was ranked and weighted based on the literature, expert surveys, and random forest technique to perform hot spot analysis and generate a critical road index map. Statistical analysis of spatial clustering and hot spot spatial densities was carried out based on Moran’s I method of spatial autocorrelation, Getis–Ord Gi* statistics, and point kernel density. Based on weighted attributes of more than 130,000 incidents from Harris County, Texas, for the period between 2004 and 2013, the method successfully identified critical road segments and highlighted factors that contribute to criticality. The results show that high-severity segments are located in the downtown area during the period of 2004 to 2010, and shifted northwest of the downtown area during the period of 2010 to 2013. The random forest variable importance revealed that the number of lanes blocked along with time periods was the most critical factor affecting the severity of traffic incidents. Though the application of the method was demonstrated using incident database from Harris County, it can be generalized to other cities.

The costs of traffic accidents are enormous, killing 1.35 million people every year and costing 3% of most countries' GDP. Recent research aims to target interventions at high-accident-density locations, called accident hotspots. New methods and technologies can systematically identify hotspots, but it remains unclear whether hotspots contribute to accident costs as well as volume. This paper investigates the monetary and human costs of accident hotspots. We analyze a dataset of all accidents from 2011 - 2017 in Switzerland. We identify hotspots, then analyze their contributions to traffic accident costs. We find that hotspot accidents are not different in monetary costliness or injury rates from non-hotspot accidents, so hotspots drive costs along with accident volume. However, hotspot accidents are less fatal, so hotspot targeting might not be best for fatalities. If hotspots are reduced to normal road conditions, total monetary costs can be reduced by up to 5% per year as a theoretical upper bound. Targeting the top 10% most frequent, costly, injurious, or deadly hotspots yeilds different results for different cost types, with accident number and monetary cost targets creating the highest reductions overall. © 2019 IEEE.","Export Date: 10 May 2021 | RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: SavingCosts | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Conference Proceeding",,"Cost reduction;Intelligent systems;Intelligent vehicle highway systems;Accident costs;Density locations;Monetary costs;Recent researches;Reduction targets;Road condition;Switzerland;Traffic accident costs;Accidents;Accidents, Traffic",,

In addition, the practicability of the identification methods has been optimized. Furthermore, risk of accident involvement and safety benefits of treatment,two ranking criteria of black spots were suggested. Accident data for signalized intersections in two cities were collected. The accident-data-based advanced empirical Bayes method was used to identify total accident black spots and fatal and injury accident black spots in city A. The total number of accident black spots identified in city A were subsequently ranked according to the risk of accident involvement. Concurrently, black spots in city B were identified by the accident-prediction-model-based advanced empirical Bayes method, and were ranked according to risk of accident involvement and safety benefits of treatment two criteria. The results show that 24 total accident black spots and 18 fatal and injury accident black spots were identified in city A at 95% confidence level, while 15 black spots were identified in city B at 99% confidence level. The advanced empirical Bayes method is superior to the rate quality control and accident rate methods regarding accuracy, the ability to eliminate the impact of random fluctuation and the regression-to-the-mean effect of accident frequency. The ranking criterion of the safety benefits of treatment favors the locations that are more cost-effective to treat, while the ranking criterion of the risk of accident involvement favors the locations with higher deviation from the expected values. 7 tabs, 4 figs, 35 refs. © 2019, Editorial Department of Journal of Chang'an University (Natural Science Edition).

To solve this problem, speeding prediction is recognized as a critical step in a pre-warning system. While previous studies have shown that speeding is affected by road environmental design, research in predicting speeding behavior through road environment features has not yet been conducted. Furthermore, there is a large discrepancy between actual and perceived road environmental information given that a driver's visual perception plays a crucial role as the dominant source of information in determining driver's behavior. Thus, this paper aims to establish a speeding prediction model based on quantifying the visual road environment to improve the design of pre-waring systems, which can predict whether drivers are going to speed and provide them with visual or/and audio warnings about their current driving speed and the speed limit prior to the occurrence of speeding behavior. Twenty input variables derived from three categories including visual road environment parameters, vehicle kinematic features driver characteristics were considered in the proposed speeding prediction model. Especially, the road environmental design factors consisting of the visual road geometry and visual roadside environment as perceived by the driver's eyes were quantified using a visual road environment model. Field experiments were conducted to collect naturalistic driving data concerning speeding behavior on the typical two-lane mountainous rural highways in five provinces of China. Random Forests, an ensemble learning method for regression and classification, were applied to build the speeding prediction model and variable importance was calculated. Additionally, logistic regression was used as a supplement to further investigate factors impacting on speeding behavior. A speeding criterion was defined with two levels in this study: a lower level (exceeding the posted speed limit) and a higher level (10% above the posted speed limit). Under both levels of the speeding criterion, the speeding prediction model performed well with high accuracy (over 85%). This model could use the value of the variables obtained from the current position to predict drivers’ speeding behavior at the future position located a sighting distance away. This interval was sufficient for a pre-warning system to give a speeding warning that a driver with normal perception-reaction time (around 2.5 s) could respond to. Findings in this study can be used to effectively predict speeding in advance and help to reduce speeding-related traffic accidents. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :10

Based on road traffic crash data from 2014 to 2016 in Shenzhen, China, this study first applied geocoding methods to locate the crashes and obtain their spatial distributions. Then, using the method of density analysis, areas with a high frequency and severity of crashes were identified. The differences in spatial patterns of crashes depending on whether road network density was considered in the density analysis were investigated and the possible causes of these differences were analyzed. Finally, using two types of disaggregated spatial clustering models, outlier analysis and hot spot analysis, those areas with a greater severity of traffic crashes were further identified. Comparative analysis was conducted on the results derived from the two clustering methods. The results show that in per unit land area, a greater number of traffic crashes occur in downtown Shenzhen than in the suburban areas of Shenzhen, whereas in per unit-length road, more crashes occur in the suburban areas of Shenzhen than in downtown Shenzhen. Severity of crashes in suburban areas is higher than that of the crashes in downtown areas. These regional differences may be related to the higher speed limits and inadequate traffic safety measures in suburban areas. The results of cluster analysis are essentially similar to those of the density analysis. In the suburban areas of Shenzhen, clusters of crashes with high severity are formed, whereas in the downtown areas, clusters of crashes with low severity are formed with low severity. This difference also means that the severity of traffic crashes in suburban areas is generally greater than that in downtown areas. A comparison of the two methods shows that the density analysis is simple and easy to perform and can thus help traffic control departments attain an intuitive and rapid understanding of the spatial patterns of urban road traffic crashes. Cluster analysis can be accurate to the level of crash points and can thus be used for delicate traffic safety management. The results of this study show that the methods of density analysis and cluster analysis can play a useful role in determining the spatial patterns of urban road traffic crashes. © 2019, Editorial Department of China Journal of Highway and Transport.

This study examines the stability of the performance of two spatial autocorrelation measures on the basis of a Road Safety Risk Index (RSRI) through the comparison of the results for three regions (North-West, Center-East, and Center-West) and for three time periods (2002–2005, 2006–2009 and 2010–2013) in Tunisia. Our study differs from others in that it discusses the identification of probable hot zones and enhances the capability to examine a given highway by determining “dangerous probable lengths”, which aims to anticipate the traffic crashes in the future. The identified hot zones and probable hot zones exhibit different regional and temporal characteristics. There are clearly some outstanding spatial clusters of crashes covering specific locations. In both Northwest and Center-West regions, the majority of the identified hot zones and probable hot zones predominantly occur along mainly highways characterized by a dominant rural character. In the Center-East region, both hot zones and probable hot zones are mostly spread northeast and south-west more precisely in NH1 and NH2 where many urban activities are taking place.

The success of any method applied in identifying a high-risk location or black spot (BS) on the road should depend fundamentally on how data is organized into specific homogeneous segments. The appropriate combination of black spot identification (BSID) method and segmentation method contributes significantly to the reduction in false positive (a site involved in safety investigation while it is not needed) and false negative (not involving a site in safety investigation while it is needed) cases in identifying BS segments. The purpose of this research is to study and compare the effect of methodological diversity of road network segmentation on the performance of different BSID methods. To do this, four commonly applied BS methods (empirical Bayesian (EB), excess EB, accident frequency, and accident ratio) have been evaluated against four different segmentation methods (spatial clustering, constant length, constant traffic volume, and the standard Highway Safety Manual segmentation method). Two evaluations have been used to compare the performance of the methods. The approach first evaluates the segmentation methods based on the accuracy of the developed safety performance function (SPF). The second evaluation applies consistency tests to compare the joint performances of the BS methods and segmentation methods. In conclusion, BSID methods showed a significant change in their performance depending on the different segmentation method applied. In general, the EB method has surpassed the other BSID methods in case of all segmentation approaches. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :13

Previous research generally paid attentions to the influences of specific road characteristics (e.g. curvature) on driving behaviors. Limited studies have focused on how drivers identify different alignments and how they further take the varying speed choices. This study aims at filling the gap by investigating the subjective categorization of road alignments based on middle-aged driver groups. A total of sixteen participants with ages ranging from 23 to 40 years were recruited. Participants were first asked to undertake naturalistic driving tests on a four-lane divided mountainous freeway while photos of the road and the driving speed were collected. Participants were then asked to subjectively sort the photos of the road into piles, within each pile we considered their driving behaviors would be similar. Finally, questionnaire survey was conducted in terms of comfort, safety, speed choice and sight distance. The picture grouping revealed three distinct and non-overlapping subjective categories of road alignment. And driver's ratings about comfort and safety were significantly different between these categories. The category with the largest sight distance and highest speed choice turned out to have the lowest rating in comfort and safety (note that the rating scales for comfort and safety had reversed polarity such that low numbers indicated high comfort and high safety). Statistical evidences indicated that the drivers have developed underlying mental schema about road alignment. Therefore, their speed choices on combined alignment were further investigated. The difference between actual driving speed and driver's expected speed showed close relation to the ratings and significant difference between two of the categories. Road with large absolute value in speed difference informed inconsistency between geometric design and driver's expectation from the aspects of drivers’ perception and expectation of the road. The findings provided insight into how middle-aged driver views and categorizes road alignment. And it was found that the drivers relied on visual characteristics of the alignment to distinguish the categories instead of separate horizontal and vertical geometric parameters. It was implied that more considerations should be taken into driver's perception of road during alignment design to improve road safety. © 2019 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :5

Considering the lack of resources for implementing safety treatments, prioritizing unsafe points is an important and complicated issue where the effectiveness of each safety treatment option should be thoroughly investigated. The political, social, and environmental aspects should also be taken into consideration, including social and political pressures and officials talks on less important topics. Obviously, this inappropriate resource allocation poses a serious challenge to the expected goals. In this study, a methodology based on economic and social issues is proposed to optimize the annual budget allocation for eliminating or reducing the risk of accident-prone points. In this methodology, the spatial and temporal distribution of budget is determined using a mathematical model aimed to maximize the benefits of reducing the accidents after deducting the costs of implementing the safety countermeasures. The outputs of this model include the safety countermeasure alternatives and a five-year time schedule for implementing them, or the alternative of no action with regard to budget, social, and judicial constraints. In order to evaluate the proposed method, it is applied to the road network of Iran and the results are compared with those of the conventional method that is currently used for resource allocation in this country. The results show that the proposed method leads to 15% higher benefits compared to the conventional method. Moreover, this method makes 641 safe points, which is about 17% more than the safe points resulted from the existing method. Therefore, the proposed method brings about a safer network as a result of the optimal allocation of available resources. © 2019","Cited By :1

Consequently, Forward Collision Warning (FCW) algorithms have been developed to mitigate this type of critical collision by warning drivers about an impending rear-end event. The algorithms are typically tested to ensure their effectiveness in reducing specific events, such as rear-end conflicts and/or collisions, or by assessing the change in the frequency and severity of braking maneuvers. Such assessments are usually microscopic in nature and deal with isolated (independent) situations. This paper aims at assessing six FCW algorithms at a network level with varying market penetration rates using a calibrated micro-simulation model. The algorithms were assessed in terms of their safety (rear-end conflicts frequency), mobility (travel times), and environmental impacts (emissions and fuel consumption). Based on the results of this study, most of the FCW algorithms did not have a significant effect on mobility nor environmental impacts at various market penetration rates. On the contrary, all the algorithms showed significant safety improvements, in terms of reducing rear-end conflicts, as the market penetration rates increased. The only exception was a single algorithm that tends to be more conservative in terms of braking distance. The results showed that situational improvements (on a driver level) caused by using FCW systems will generally translate into systematic improvements (on a network level). This is important due to the anticipated gradual increase in intelligent vehicles, which are expected to be equipped with FCW systems, on our roads soon. © The Author(s) 2018.","Cited By :4

By identifying locations where traffic accidents frequently occur and highway sections with high accident rates, traffic authorities can adopt preventive measures and enforce traffic regulations to reduce the frequency of traffic accidents, deaths, injuries, and financial losses. The present study analyzed tourist traffic accidents in Nantou County, one of the most popular tourist areas in Taiwan for domestic and international travelers, and tabulated statistical data that were subsequently input into a GIS database to determine dangerous locations and areas where traffic accidents are prone to occur. First, administrative regions in Nantou County were identified and kernel density estimation and repeatability analysis were performed to determine locations with high accident rates. The results showed that in Nantou County, traffic accidents often occur between 12:00 and 18:00 at intersections and on sloped roads and windy roads. The most dangerous locations were Provincial Highway 21 (areas around Sun Moon Lake) and Provincial Highway 14A (areas with access to Qingjing and Hehuanshan).

Most statistical methods for that purpose have utilized greater-than-expected crash frequencies. However, methods utilizing higher-than-expected proportions of target crashes can also be used. One such method is included in the Highway Safety Manual (HSM). The HSM identifies crash patterns by making inferences from a Bayesian posterior beta-binomial probability distribution of the crash proportion at each location. For this research, another Bayesian method, hierarchical Bayesian logistic regression (HB), is applied and compared with the HSM. For this method, a mixture of three normal distributions was used to estimate location effects and handle an asymmetrical long-tailed crash frequency distribution. The methods are empirically tested and compared using signalized intersection crash data from Minnesota from 2003 to 2007. The proposed method demonstrated that the HB model is a robust alternative to identify crash patterns, particularly for multimodal or sparsely distributed data. The HB method is aligned theoretically with location ranking and inference strategies. It is shown to more efficiently identify crash patterns than the HSM method although the HB method is more computationally complex and demanding. © 2017, © 2017 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC & The University of Tennessee.","Cited By :1

The loss of human life due to accident is to be avoided. There is no technology in current times for detection of accident. Reaching of ambulance to the accident location is mostly delayed due to the conjested traffic that increases the chance of victim death. To reduce loss of life or save life of person due to accidents and reduce the time taken by ambulance to reach the hospital, there is a need of system which needs to come into force in our daily lives. To bar loss of human life due to accidents, we introduce a scheme called automatic accident rescue system (AARS). There is an automatic detection of accident by crash sensors in the vehicle. A GPS module in the vehicle will send the location coordinates of the accident using IoT platform to central unit which will notify and send an ambulance from the nearest hospital in the vicinity to the accident spot. This scheme is fully automated; thus, it finds the accident spot, helping to reach the hospital in time.

This paper looks into the driving environment factors in pedestrian crashes injury levels on road links in Jakarta and the surounding cities which contribute to the city traffic generation. The vehicle-pedestrian accident data used were obtained from the 2016 Indonesian national police accident database covering 4,646 pedestrian accidents on road links from Jakarta, Depok, Tangerang Selatan, Tangerang and Bekasi, Indonesia. Various factors were analyzed including crash level severity, month of occurrence, weather condition, lighting condition, road function, road class, road type, road surface condition and road status. As injury levels were categorized into slight injury, severe injury and fatal injury and it was assumed that the dependent variables which were crash injury levels could not be perfectly predicted from the independent variables, Multinomial logistic regression (MNL) was used in the analysis to predict the probability of different categories of dependent variables. It was found that the relative risks of pedestrian accident risks factors changed with different categories both in terms of fatal and severe injuries. One of the findings shows that the risk of having severe injuries would decrease by 40.2% on national roads, by 70.5% on provincial roads and by 53.5% on urban roads.

However, there are several main problems related to channelization design at intersections, including poor recognizability, unreasonable entering speed, insufficient sight distance, and relatively low merging speed. To address these problems, this paper focused on developing a method to assess how to design intersection features by dividing the driving process through intersections into four stages: 'appearance of channelization,' 'beginning of channelization,' 'middle of channelization,' and 'end of channelization.' Drivers' visual lane models were established based on the Catmull-Rom spline to quantify visual road information perceived by drivers. Shape parameters and three characteristic regions were extracted from these models. The naturalistic driving experiments and 3D mobile mapping experiments were conducted at intersections with channelized islands or guidelines. Driving speed distributions in the four stages were found to obey normal distributions and could be calculated by shape parameters with Bayesian inference. Then, 3D mobile mapping was used as a substitute for extensive naturalistic driving experiments to obtain drivers' visual perception from all possible visual angles. An evaluation method on intersection design was built and used to identify which stage of channelization needs to be modified. This new method helps to enhance the safety and efficiency of intersections. © 2019 IEEE.","Cited By :7

The HSM predictive methods require the roadway network to be divided into homogeneous segments and intersections, or sites populated with a series of attributes. It recommends a minimum segment length of 0.1 mi. This research focuses on segment lengths of less than 0.1 mi for statewide screening of midblock crash locations to identify site specific locations with high crash incidence. The paper makes an argument that many midblock crashes can be concentrated along a very short segment because of an undesirable characteristic of a specific site. The use of longer segments may “hide” the severity of a single location if the rest of the segment has few or no additional crashes. In actuality, this research does not divide sections of roads into short segments. Instead, a short-window approach is used. The underlying road network is used to create a layer of segment polygons using GIS buffering. Crash data are then overlaid and aggregated to the segment polygons for further analysis. The paper makes a case for the use of short fixed segments to do statewide screening and how accurately geocoded crash data is key to its use. A comparison is made with a sliding-window approach (Network Kernel Density). The benefit of using fixed segments is that they are much less complex than using the sliding-window approach. Because the segmentation can be the same from year to year, direct comparisons can be made over time while spatial integrity is maintained. © National Academy of Sciences: Transportation Research Board 2019.","Cited By :1

Roads in large- and medium-sized cities are becoming increasingly congested, which leads to frequent traffic accidents. To enhance road traffic safety and reduce the traffic accident rate, effectively identifying accident black spots is of great importance. In this study, the data from traffic accidents on the Lianfeng Middle Road, Yinzhou District, Ningbo City were selected for the analytical dataset, and eight impact factors (holiday, day of week, time, rush hour traffic, accident location type, accident type, weather, responsibility and black spot) were set. The improved K-means clustering algorithm was proposed to solve the shortcomings of the traditional algorithm, which is susceptible to outliers and initial clustering centres. Through this algorithm, the traffic accidents in the dataset were divided into two categories: black spots and non-black spots. Then, using the updated dataset, we employed a Bayesian network to construct a black spot identification model, and applied other widely used algorithms (the ID3 decision tree, logistic regression and support vector machine) for comparison. The values of the ROC area, TP rate, FP rate, precision, recall, F-measure and accuracy reached 0.618, 0.668, 0.580, 0.650, 0.668, 0.590 and 0.668, respectively, which showed that the Bayesian network was the best model to effectively identify road accident black spots. Moreover, a bivariate correlation model was applied to verify the correlation between the impact factors and black spots. The results indicated that the accident location type, accident type, time, and responsibility had significant correlations with black spots, which had a value of sig<0.05. The conclusions could provide reference evidence for the identification and prevention of traffic accident black spots to significantly contribute to traffic safety. © 2013 IEEE.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

Existing research is based mainly on the statistical analysis of traffic crashes involving pedestrians and their causes, without the identification of areas vulnerable to traffic crashes that involve pedestrians. The main aim of this paper is to identify areas vulnerable to school-aged pedestrian-vehicle crashes at a local level to support the local authorities in implementing new urban traffic safety measures. The vulnerable areas were determined by computing the severity index (SI) based on the number of fatal, serious, and slight casualties throughout the 2011-2016 period in a large urban agglomeration (Bucharest). As well as the vulnerable areas, the triggering factors and the time intervals related to school-aged pedestrian-vehicle crashes were identified. The outcomes of the study showed that the vulnerable areas were concentrated only in districts 2 and 4 of Bucharest, and they were associated with high vehicle speed and pedestrians' unsafe crossing behavior. The findings revealed that speed and age are triggering factors in generating school-aged pedestrian-vehicle crashes. The identified time peaks with a high number of traffic crashes correspond to the afternoon time intervals, when scholars go home from school. The identification of the areas vulnerable to school-aged pedestrian crashes may help local authorities in identifying and implementing measures to improve traffic safety in large urban agglomerations. © 2019 by the authors.","Cited By :2

Road accidents have huge socioeconomic impact, especially in developing nations like India. Indian cities are expanding rapidly, causing rapid increment in the vehicle population leading to enhanced risk of fatalities. There is an urgent need to reduce number of road crashes by identifying the parameters affecting crashes in a road network. This paper describes a multiple regression model approach that can be applied to crash data to predict vehicle crashes. In this paper, crash prediction models were developed on the basis of accident data observed during a 5-year monitoring period extending between 2011 and 2015 in Bhopal which is a medium size city and capital of the state of Madhya Pradesh, India. The model developed in this paper appears to be useful for many applications such as the detection of critical factors, the estimation of accident reduction due to infrastructure and geometric improvement, and prediction of accident counts when comparing different design options. © Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd. 2019.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

In addition to various behaviors of drivers, the acceleration lane length of expressway weaving area is generally short, which makes it more prone to trig traffic disorder and become a traffic accident blackspot. Increasing the acceleration lane length of expressway weaving area can provide larger buffer space for the merging process of vehicles. However, a longer length generally means a higher infrastructure investment. Consequently, an optimal length of acceleration lane is essential for the expressway road infrastructure development. This paper uses the empirical survey data and a microscopic simulation system, called Traffic Parallel Simulation System (TPSS), as the simulation platform to build and verify the lane-changing model in expressway weaving area. By means of the developed weaving area simulation model, the impacts of various acceleration lane length on the traffic flow service levels are investigated, for obtaining the recommended value of acceleration lane length under different levels of services.

Most previous studies use point-based interpolation, but they ignore the critical information of the road segment itself. This can lead to inaccurate predictions, which will negatively affect decision making of road agencies. To address this problem, segment-based regression kriging (SRK) is proposed for traffic volume prediction with differentiation between heavy and light vehicles in the Wheatbelt region of Western Australia. Cross validations reveal that the prediction accuracy for heavy vehicles is significantly improved by SRK (R2 = 0.677). Specifically, 78% of spatial variance and 53% of estimated uncertainty are improved by SRK for heavy vehicles compared with regression kriging, a best performing point-based geostatistical model. This improvement shows that SRK can provide new insights into the spatial characteristics and spatial homogeneity of a road segment. Implementation results of SRK-based predictions show that the impact of heavy vehicles on road maintenance is much larger than that of light vehicles and it varies across space, and the total impacts of heavy vehicles account for more than 82% of the road maintenance burden even though its volume only accounts for 21% of traffic. © 2000-2011 IEEE.","Cited By :19

More than 85% (1.05 million) of the global deaths due to injuries occur in the developing world. Road traffic deaths and injuries are a major but neglected public health challenge that requires concerted efforts for effective and sustainable prevention. The objectives of the study were to estimate the incidence rate of death from RTAs, to determine factors associated with serious and fatal Road Traffic Accidents (RTAs) and to determine which of the poisson models fit the count data better. Methods: Data was collected from Zambia Police (ZP), Traffic Division on accidents that occurred on the Great North Road (GNR) highway between Lusaka and Kapiri-Mposhi in Zambia from January 1, 2010 to December 31, 2016. Results from standard Poisson regression were compared to those obtained using the Negative Binomial (NB), Zero-Truncated Negative Binomial (ZTNB) and the Zero-Truncated Poisson (ZTP) regression models. Diagnostic tests were used to determine the best fit model. The data was analysed using STATA software, version 14.0 SE (Stata Corporation, College Station, TX, USA). Results: A total of 1, 023 RTAs were analysed in which 1, 212 people died. Of these deaths, 82 (7%) were Juveniles and 1, 130 (93%) were adults. Cause of accident such as pedestrians crossing the road accounted for 30% (310/1,023) while 29% (295/1,023) were as a result of driver’s excessive speed. The study revealed that driving in the early hours of the day (1AM-6AM) as compared to driving in the night (7PM-12AM) had a significant increase in the incidence rate of death from RTAs, Incidence Rate Ratio (IRR) of 2.1, (95% CI={1.01-4.41}), p-value=0.048. Results further showed that public transport as compared to private transport had an increased incidence rate of death from RTAs (IRR=5.65, 95% CI={2.97-10.73}), p-value<0.0001. The two competing models were the ZTP and the ZTNB. The ZTP had AIC=1304.55, BIC= 1336.55, whereas the ZTNB had AIC=742.25 and BIC=819.69. This indicated that the ZTNB with smaller AIC and BIC was the best fit model for the data. Conclusion: There is a reduced incidence of dying if one is using a private vehicle as compared to a public vehicle. Driving in the early hours of the day (1AM and 6AM) had an increased incidence of death from RTAs. This study suggests that when dealing with counts in which there are a few zeros observed such as in serious and fatal RTAs, ZTNB fits the data well as compared to other models. © 2019 Fisa et al.","Cited By :1

In recent years, many authors have proposed various approaches to analyse historical RTA data using Geographic Information System (GIS) tools, so that locations with high instances or risk of RTA–i.e., RTA hotspots or blackspots–could be identified and ranked. This could then enable limited road engineering resources to be prioritised for remediating more critical RTA hotspots and therefore reducing RTA rates. This paper presents the development of a new validation method to evaluate the application of four different hotspot analysis methods in ESRI ArcGIS 10.2 to identify and rank RTA hotspots using historical RTA data on a section of a road in Brunei Darussalam as a case study. A road safety audit was undertaken for six locations along the study road section to identify the risk levels at these locations. These risk levels were then compared with risk levels at the same six locations computed by four hotspot analysis methods: Network KDE by SANET, KDE+, Getis-Ord Gi*, and a recently proposed risk-based method–STAA–that accounts for RTA frequency, severity and socioeconomic costs. It was found that SANET-KDE overestimated the risk levels of road sections that are free of RTA. The results from KDE + showed the most deviations compared to the identified risk levels by the road safety audit. Getis-Ord Gi* was not able to identify RTA hotspots along the study road section of Jalan Tutong. However, the STAA method provided the most consistent results in comparison with the identified risk levels by the road safety audit. STAA, by having a better validity compared to other methods, provides a promising way to prioritise RTA hotspots for remediation, and thus reducing the associated socioeconomic costs. In addition, these findings demonstrated that the novel method of validation via risk levels determined by road safety audit was able to provide an independent measure of the validity of the hotspot analysis (HSA) methods. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC and The University of Tennessee.","Cited By :7

Trabalhador São Carlense, 400, São Carlos, Brazil""]","While high road safety performing countries base their effective strategies on reliable data, in developing countries the unavailability of essential information makes this task challenging. As a result, this drawback has led researchers and planners to face dilemmas of “doing nothing” or “doing ill” therefore restricting models to data availability, often limited to socio-economic and demographic variables. Taking this into account, this study aims to demonstrate the potential improvements in spatial crash prediction model performance by enhancing the explanatory variables and modelling casualties as a function of a more comprehensive dataset, especially with an appropriate exposure variable. This includes experimental work, where models based on available information from São Paulo, Brazil, and Flanders, the Dutch speaking area of Belgium, are developed and compared with each other. Prediction models are developed within the framework of Geographically Weighted Regression with the Poisson distribution of errors. Moreover, casualties and fatalities as the response variables in the models developed for Flanders and São Paulo, respectively, are divided into two sets based on the transport mode, called active (i.e., pedestrians and cyclists) and motorized transport (i.e., motorized vehicle occupants). In order to assess the impacts of the enriched information on model performance, casualties are firstly associated with all available variables for São Paulo and the corresponding ones for Flanders. In the next step, prediction models are developed only for Flanders considering all the available information in the Flemish dataset. Findings showed that by adding the supplementary data, reductions of 20% and 25% for motorized transport, and 25% and 35% for active transport resulted in AICc and MSPE, respectively. Considering the practical aspects, results could help identify hotspots and relate most influential factors, suggesting sites and data, which should be prioritized in future local investigations. Besides minimizing costs with data collection, it could help policy makers to identify, implement and enforce appropriate countermeasures. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :11

Safety effects were estimated for total casualty, high severity (fatality and serious injury) and other injury crashes. For conducting EB method a reference group was selected with similar traffic volumes and site characteristics to the treated sites. Negative Binomial regression was applied to develop SPFs that were used to predict the expected number of crashes at the treated sites. The results of EB approach revealed that the treatment effect was found to be significant at 95% confidence level for all crash severity levels.

Two spatial statistical methods (Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi*) were used to determine whether crashes on this highway showed spatial clustering over time from a global and local perspective. Globally, recurrent crash clusters are spatially correlated on vertical curves and straight highway sections on northern R5 with different truck types and with the tractor-trailer units during rainy days on southern R5. The local spatial autocorrelation results suggest that the contributing causes related to the loss of control of the vehicle, the fatigue and imprudence of the driver, and crashes involving tractor units with trailer tend to cause persistent rollover crash clusters throughout R5. Overall, clustering of crash attributes with high values (i.e., hot spots) occurring on highway locations with vertical curves and on cloudy days predominated in the northern R5, and the largest number of recurrent hot spots occurred on sunny days along southern R5. A hot spot spatial co-occurrence analysis was further performed to identify the strong relationships between the studied crash attributes, and the crash and injury types as outcomes. The indication of high risk for the clustering of cargo trucks on highways crashes provides a basis for improving highway safety and reduce the associated social and economic costs. © 2018","Cited By :16

However, the crash datasets used for such programs are obtained from the police and include two limitations: not all crashes are collected by the police (most minor and near-miss crashes are not reported), and the traditional process uses crash data recorded for the past two or three years (meaning most data inevitably include a time lag). To overcome these limitations, this study proposes a new approach for a TSIP based on citizen participation through an online survey that is broadcasted through social media. The method uses the public as sensors of hazardous road information, which means that information can be collected on individual experiences of minor crashes and latent risk factors, such as near misses and traffic conflicts.

In middle and high mountains, most roads are two-lane highways. Most two-lane mountain highways are located in rural areas in China, where traffic volume is relatively small; namely, traffic accidents are mainly related to the design of roads, rather than the impact of traffic flow. Previous studies primarily focused on the relationship between actual road geometry and traffic safety. However, some scholars put forward that there was a significant discrepancy between actual and visual perceived information. Drivers greatly depend on what they perceived by their vision to determine driving behavior. Thus, in this paper drivers’ visual lane model was established to quantify drivers’ visual perception. To further explore drivers’ perception of horizontal and vertical alignments, the visual lane model was projected onto horizontal and vertical planes in drivers’ vision respectively. The length and curvature of the visual curve were extracted as shape parameters of drivers’ visual lane models. Real vehicle driving tests were conducted on typical two-lane mountain highway sections of G318 in Tibet, China. Then the differences of visual perception at black spots and accident-free locations were analyzed and compared. In horizontal and vertical projections of visual lane model, there were 9 shape parameters have significant differences between accident-prone and accident-free locations. A probabilistic neural network (PNN) was formed to identify accident-prone locations on two-lane mountain highways. This study will lay a foundation for the improvement of traffic safety on mountain highways based on the quantification of drivers’ visual perception, during the phase of both road design and reconstruction, and can also make a contribution to the automatic driving technique. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :11

Road accident data over a period of 8 years on different sections of eight highways in India were collected from police records. In addition, data relating to road geometry, traffic and road environment related variables were collected through field studies. A total of 222 data points was gathered by dividing highways into sections with certain uniform geometric characteristics. Two modelling approaches were used (RENB and SVM models) to predict accident frequencies. The results showed encouraging performance of the SVM model in comparison with the RENB model in terms of both the correlation coefficient and root mean square error values. The SVM, originating from statistical learning theory, can better solve over-fitting and local minima problems and the results indicate that this approach can effectively be used as an alternative to the RENB approach if the sole aim is to predict crashes. The results clearly indicate that, to improve safety on Indian highways, minor access roads to highways and service roads need to be properly designed and controlled and the dispersion of speeds needs to be reduced. © 2018 ICE Publishing.

The mobile step method considered the number of traffic accidents and resulting casualties for a quantitative measure of traffic accidents. The accumulative frequency method was used to analyze the accidents, and obtain sections with relatively concentrated number of accidents under various combinations, then which were merged as the primary black spots according to the principle of adjacent sections. For primary black spots, appropriate neighborhood and threshold values were selected, and the density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise (DBSCAN) algorithm was used for cluster analysis to seek out the ""real"" black spots with short lengths and concentrated accident occurrences. To verify the reliability of the identification method, black spots were identified for various sections of the Mazhao Expressway. The results show that length of the accident-prone section identified by the accumulative frequency method accounts for 28.4% of the total length of the segment, and the number of equivalent accidents accounts for 56.4% of the total number of accidents,on the basis of dynamic segment division. Thus, dividing the road unit dynamically by the mobile step method can identify the black spots to a great extent. The lengths of the real black spots only account for 10.8% of the total length, and the number of equivalent accidents accounts for 52.5% of the total number of accidents,When the DBSCAN algorithm is used to re-examine the obtained primary black spots. Thus the length of black spot sections have decreased by 61%, while the number of accidents remained almost the same. The combination of dynamic segmentation and the DBSCAN algorithm can be used to eliminate ""non-black"" road sections in the primary road segment and identify the real black point segments. This method greatly improves the identification accuracy of black spots, and provides reliable technical support for effective elimination of traffic accident black spots. 3 tabs, 5 figs, 19 refs. ©2018, Editorial Department of Journal of Chang'an University (Natural Science Edition).

It has brought a rapid growth as an important transport mode in many countries by providing several benefits for traffic, health and cost. However, the growing in bicycle utilization demand causes many problems such as safety, effectiveness etc. For this reason, other effective parameters on urban transport should be considered when planning new safe bicycle paths in the spatial platform. In this study, it was aimed to examine all these negative and positive effective parameters on safety and choice while integrating cycling with a public transport (bus link) system. To determine effective parameters on route choice, a Questionnaire Survey (QS) was carried out on 460 participants who are cycling for a long time in Isparta City/Turkey. It was obtained from the QS that Accident Prone Areas (APA) are the most important factor on cycling and public transport integration. The other parameters are determined as Bus Lane (BL), Road Side Car Park (RSCP), Bicycle Parks (BP), Road Grade (RG), Signalization (S), Traffic Capacity (TC), Connected Bike Lane (CBL) and Separated Bike Lane (SBL) according to their importance. In order to determine safer and serviceable bicycle routes selection problem, accident-prone locations (using Accident Reports and Geographic Information Systems-GIS), bus lines and survey data has been used in GIS. Also, a multi-criteria decision making approach Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) method is implemented to analyze survey data and decide effective parameters on safer and serviceable bicycle routes. It was found that safer and serviceable bicycle routes can be determined by the utilization of QS, GIS and AHP methods with together.

This paper describes a framework to benchmark different regions (neighborhoods, provinces, etc.) in terms of a selected safety performance measure. To avoid issues relating to aggregated (macro-level) data, we use disaggregate (micro-level) data to draw inferences at a macro/region-level, which is often needed for developing large-scale transportation safety and planning programs and policies. To overcome unobserved heterogeneity, we employ a multilevel Bayesian heteroskedastic Poisson lognormal model with grouped random parameters allowing heterogeneity in both mean and variance parameters. The proposed approach is illustrated through a comprehensive study of highway railway grade crossings across Canada. The results indicate that the proposed model addresses unobserved heterogeneity more efficiently and provides more insight compared to conventional random parameters models. For example, we found that as traffic exposure increases, grade crossing safety deteriorates at a higher rate in the Canadian Prairies than in the other regions. Our benchmarking framework is also affected by different model specifications. The results indicate the need for further in-depth investigations, which could help to identify possible reasons for inter-region differences in terms of specific safety indicators.

Despite the effectiveness on travel demand forecasting, it is important to recognize that alternative approaches have been developed in recent years. Traditional methods, besides considering different explanatory variables, are appropriate to make estimates exclusively on previously surveyed households. On the other hand, recent studies have addressed spatial statistical concerns in the field of travel demand forecasting. The aim of this paper is to spatially estimate motorized travel mode choice probabilities in a continuous map using an Origin-Destination Survey database, conducted in the São Paulo Metropolitan Area in Brazil in 2007. Values were estimated in both sampled and non-sampled coordinates. This paper proposes a conjoint approach that combines the traditional procedure of travel demand forecasting (multiple logistic regression) with a spatial statistical method (ordinary kriging). A comparison is made with the one-step spatial method—indicator kriging (IK). Conjoint studies of spatial statistics and traditional methods are thriving in transportation analysis, giving rise to a travel mode choice surface in a confirmatory way. It is concluded that the proposed method can be used for future predictions of travel mode choices, unlike IK. © 2017, Springer International Publishing AG.","Cited By :8

Our research utilizes a geographically weighted regression (GWR) model to explore the relationships between crashes and the built environment in the context of the Detroit region in Michigan. We find that the relationships between the built environment and crashes are spatially non-stationary: both the strength and the direction of their relationships differ over space. Our study also identifies several built environment variables, such as commercial use percentage, local road mileage percentage, and intersection density, that have relatively stable relationships with crashes.

Especially on the road connecting two border provinces, traffic accidents are increasing substantially in parallel with the quantity of transport facilities. By determining areas where traffic accidents result in deaths or injuries, accident prevention strategies can be developed. This study applies the spatial statistics techniques using Geographical Information Systems (GIS) to determine the intensity of traffic accidents (hot-spot regions) over 45 km of main routes in Rize Province, Turkey. Traffic accidents recorded in data spanning 5 years are combined with a geographical dataset for evaluation using hot spot statistical analysis. Unlike other studies, this study used hot spot analysis based on network spatial weights (an innovative review in the methods of determining traffic accident hot spots: “novel application of GIScience”) to identify black spots for traffic safety. To perform the analysis using Hot Spot Analysis: Getis-Ord Gi*, a generated network dataset and the spatial weights of the road data are used to generate network spatial weights.

Reducing the road traffic injuries and the financial losses caused by collisions is the most important goal of traffic management. In addition, traffic collisions are a major cause of traffic congestion, which is a serious issue that affects everyone in the society. Therefore, traffic collision analysis is essential for all parties, including drivers, pedestrians, and traffic officers, to understand the road risks at a finer spatio-temporal scale. However, traffic collisions in the urban context are dynamic and complex. Thus, it is important to detect how the collision hotspots evolve over time through spatio-temporal clustering analysis. In addition, traffic collisions are not isolated events in space. The characteristics of the traffic collisions and their surrounding locations also present an influence of the clusters. This work tries to explore the spatio-temporal clustering patterns of traffic collisions by combining a set of network-constrained methods. These methods were tested using the traffic collision data in Jianghan District of Wuhan, China. The results demonstrated that these methods offer different perspectives of the spatio-temporal clustering patterns. The weighted network kernel density estimation provides an intuitive way to incorporate attribute information. The network cross K-function shows that there are varying clustering tendencies between traffic collisions and different types of POIs. The proposed network differential Local Moran’s I and network local indicators of mobility association provide straightforward and quantitative measures of the hotspot changes. This case study shows that these methods could help researchers, practitioners, and policy-makers to better understand the spatio-temporal clustering patterns of traffic collisions. © 2018 Fan et al.

In view of the drawback of the traditional K-means clustering algorithm, i.e., slow convergence and low accuracy, an improved K-means clustering algorithm was proposed to eliminate the influence of outliers on the clustering results and identify the accident black spots automatically. The results show that the effective accident data sampled based on the mobile phone APP account for 96.4% of the actual alarm amount, which can meet the requirement of the accuracy and quality for the accident data analysis; the change trend of each quarter over the last four years' accidents exhibits an obvious erratic change. The number of accidents between motor vehicles was the highest, followed by the accidents involving motor vehicles and non-motorized vehicles, and the proportions were 58.4% and 15.8% respectively. In terms of temporal characteristics, the number of accidents on a Monday is the highest with the rate of 15.4%, the lowest on a Thursday with the rate of 13.2%; in terms of space characteristics, the locations of road traffic accidents are primarily concentrated in the ground sections, road intersections, and parking lot, where the accident rates are 77.4%, 11.6%, and 7.0% respectively.

Compared with crash frequency models dedicated to motorized mode users, the use of these models has been considerably scarce in the multimodal literature. To fill this research gap, the authors aimed to develop and evaluate three multivariate space-time models with different temporal trends and spatiotemporal interactions. The model estimates justified the use of mode-varying coefficients for explanatory variables as the impact of these factors varied across different crash modes. Largely, a similar set of influential covariates was generated by the three models which indicate their robustness. However, notable differences were observed from the assessment of evaluation criteria pertaining to predictive accuracy based on criteria assessing the training and test errors. The model with time-varying spatial random effects demonstrated superior performance for training and test errors. However, due to the significant increase in number of effective parameters that were utilized for model development, this model appeared to have the largest value of deviance information criterion (DIC). In terms of the comparison between models based on site ranking performance, the time-varying spatial random effects model demonstrated the best performance in both site consistency and method consistency. In other words, the superiority of the model's predictive performance could be transferred to yield more accurate result at site ranking. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :16

These systems mainly use sensors installed on the vehicle and help drivers deal with human operation errors. Traffic accidents are inherently unpredictable, and it is difficult to prevent mistakes made by others. Therefore, the concept of defensive driving has attracted much interest. Defensive driving aims to increase drivers' self-awareness to prevent accidents. Future self-driving vehicles should integrate defensive driving to improve driver safety. This paper proposes a framework based on the risk evaluation value of defensive driving that rapidly transmits information about high-accident-likelihood zones to drivers or vehicles by using Internet of Vehicles technology. This should enable drivers or self-driving vehicles to predict risks and operate vehicles safely. To send alert messages in a timely manner, it is essential to overcome the challenge of processing real-time data during driving. We design five kinds of services in this rapid response framework, including raw data receiver, warning area decision, accident pattern recognition, message generator, and user profile to analyze driver information using distributed system architecture. Message-oriented middleware is used for communication between services. This framework identifies high-accident-likelihood zones by using density-based spatial clustering of applications with noise, simplifying the process of association calculation. After the calculation, this framework uses the weighted severity index to weight and compare risk severities. According to our experimental results, the service-oriented middleware design increases the speed and stability of information transmission. © 2013 IEEE.","Cited By :7

The majority of road crashes are caused by human error, with risk heightened among young and novice drivers learning to negotiate the complexities of the road environment. Direct feedback has been shown to have a positive impact on driving behaviour. Methods that could detect behavioural changes and therefore, positively reinforce safer driving during the early stages of driver licensing could have considerable road safety benefit. A new methodology is presented combining in-vehicle telematics technology, providing measurements forming a personalised driver profile, with neural networks to identify changes in driving behaviour. Using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks, individual drivers are identified based on their pattern of acceleration, deceleration and exceeding the speed limit. After model calibration, new, real-time data of the driver is supplied to the LSTM and, by monitoring prediction performance, one can assess whether a (positive or negative) change in driving behaviour is occurring over time. The paper highlights that the approach is robust to different neural network structures, data selections, calibration settings, and methodologies to select benchmarks for safe and unsafe driving. Presented case studies show additional model applications for investigating changes in driving behaviour among individuals following or during specific events (e.g., receipt of insurance renewal letters) and time periods (e.g., driving during holiday periods). The application of the presented methodology shows potential to form the basis of timely provision of direct feedback to drivers by telematics-based insurers. Such feedback may prevent internalisation of new, risky driving habits contributing to crash risk, potentially reducing deaths and injuries among young drivers as a result. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :23

Therefore, it is an indicator leading to an accident. Near-miss analysis does not look at what happened but look into what could have happened. Serious conflicts are the result of a breakdown in the interaction between the road user, environment and vehicle, which leads to traffic accidents. As the similarity between accidents and serious conflicts is striking, accidents can basically be prevented by isolating and handling the conflicts potentials. The Swedish Traffic Conflict analysis of near-miss accidents is adopted in this study to improve the traffic safety of a channelized junction with U-turn at LentengAgung, Jakarta. The junction is a two-way junction with a wide median and an island. The location has been indicated as an accident-prone location with high conflict rates. A set of traffic video-recordings employing a number of surveyors at different points of observations were carried out on-site to obtain real near-miss accidents. Prior to the survey, surveyors practiced judging vehicles running speeds until they reached a certain maximum error of judgment. Evasive actions such as braking, swerving and accelerating were recorded, and actions were classified into serious and non-serious conflicts based on the time-to-accidents and speeds. The results of the analysis show that almost all of the total recorded conflicts fall in the category of serious conflicts. An improvement scheme of the junction with reduced potential traffic conflicts is proposed, which can be expected to lower the accidents occurrences. © 2018 WIT Press","Cited By :2

The existing researches mainly focus on the analysis of aviation accident time characteristics and accident causes and less analysis of the spatial characteristics of aviation accidents. The spatial characteristics analysis of aviation accidents can identify hot spots of aviation accidents, improve the accuracy of aviation accident emergency management, and provide decision support for airport route planning. This study established the severity index of aviation accident based on aviation accident data, using GIS spatial analysis methods to study the spatial distribution characteristics of aviation accidents. The hot spots were identified in the aviation accidents. Finally, airports around the accident hot spots were ranked to obtain the airports with high potential aviation risks based on RI, taking Florida as an example. It was found that in the Florida aviation accident, general aviation accidents accounted for the majority, but the aviation accident severity index for air route flight was far greater than general aviation accidents. From the spatial distribution point of view, accidents with high severity index were distributed around large international airports. The Density Center for Aviation Accidents was located in Tampa, Miami, and some airports link areas in Florida. In terms of the Moran's I index, the distribution of aviation accidents tended to aggregate in the region as a whole. However, aviation accident severity index was randomly distributed for each year separately. At the level of significance of 0.01, there were a total of 75 accident hotspots in the Florida region, mainly in the north and southwest. Airports with high RI in the Florida area were mainly concentrated in the Miami area and the Tampa Bay area, and Orlando Airport was ranked outside the top 10. © 2018 Yafei Li and Chen Liang.","Cited By :6

For using virtual simulation technology to identify dangerous sections of roads that have been built and to provide technical support during the initial stages of road design, it is necessary to first research the reliability of virtual simulation experiments in road safety studies. The man-vehicle-road system model based on multi-body dynamics is proposed using the software of ADAMS/Car. Based on the roll and roll-over evaluation criteria, combined with speed consistency theory, the high risk and high driving load road sections are identified. Furthermore, the simulation results are compared with the measured results from six-dimensional sensor in order to verify the reliability of virtual simulation technology while applied for road shape designing. The comparison results can be seen that the simulation analysis based on virtual prototype technology of 12 sections accidents, ten with six component-based sensor anastomosis of real vehicle road test analysis section, the accident sections of results obtained from the two methods of alignment is 83.3%.

However, in the railway sector, most relevant departments currently face a challenge in drawing up a rescue scheme effectively and accurately with the insufficient information collected from the scene of a train accident. To assist with the rescue planning, we propose a framework which can rapidly and automatically construct a 3D virtual scene of a train accident by utilising photos of the accident spot. The framework uses a hybrid 3D reconstruction method to extract the position and pose information of the carriages involved in an accident. It adopts a geographic information system and a 3D visualisation engine to model and display the landscapes and buildings at the site of a train accident. In order to assess and validate our prototype, we quantitatively evaluate our main algorithm and demonstrate the usage of our technology with two case studies including a simulated scene with an in-lab setting and a real train derailment scene from on-site pictures.

Box LG115, Legon, Ghana","Deaths due to road accidents are a major concern to many stakeholders in Ghana especially because road accidents only come second behind malaria for cause of deaths. Statistical models can be helpful in evaluating the effect of factors responsible for mortality and morbidity during vehicular accidents. There is often a spoilt for choice on the type of models that may be used to explain a particular phenomenon. Picking a model can be based on the researcher's knowledge or experience and the simplicity of the model. However, in common applications, the models applied are often not adequate to accurately and efficiently explain the underlying phenomenon particularly when it fails to address certain characteristics of the data. In this paper, an appropriate statistical model on the number of vehicular deaths in Ghana is fitted. The Poisson, Negative Binomial (NB), Zero-Inflation Poisson (ZIP) and Zero-Inflation Negative Binomial (ZINB) models, estimated by the method of maximum likelihood, are compared to determine the most appropriate model for the data at hand. In addition, due to the large number of explanatory variables, the backward model selection procedure was adopted to select the most significant factors associated with crash fatalities. After a careful model building process, the ZINB model was identified as the most appropriate for modelling road crash mortality. The model also identified factors such as shoulder type, time of crash, driver's sex, road environment landmarks, among others as having significant effect on the fatalities during vehicular accidents in Ghana. It is recommended that authorities focus on installing reflective markings on the shoulders of roads and increase education of drivers in adhering to road regulations while also paying keen attention to road environmental landmarks. © 2018 - IOS Press and the authors.

As jurisdictions around the world are charged with transport network management in order to reduce externalities associated with road crashes, identifying potential blackspots or hotspots is an important if not critical function and responsibility of transport agencies. Methodology – Key references from within the literature are summarised and discussed, along with a discussion of the evolution of thinking around hotspot identification and management. The theoretical developments that correspond with the evolution in thinking are provided, sprinkled with examples along the way. Findings – Hotspot identification methodologies have evolved considerably over the past 30 or so years, correcting for methodological deficiencies along the way. Despite vast and significant advancements, identifying hotspots remains a reactive approach to managing road safety – relying on crashes to accrue in order to mitigate their occurrence. The most fruitful directions for future research will be in the establishment of reliable relationships between surrogate measures of road safety – such as ‘near misses’ – and actual crashes – so that safety can be proactively managed without the need for crashes to accrue. Research implications – Research in hotspot identification will continue; however, it is likely to shift over time to both closer to ‘real-time’ crash risk detection and considering safety improvements using surrogate measures of road safety – described in Chapter 17. Practical implications – There are two types of errors made in hotspot detection – identifying a ‘risky’ site as ‘safe’ and identifying a ‘safe’ site as ‘risky’. In the former case no investments will be made to improve safety, while in the latter case ineffective or inefficient safety improvements could be made. To minimise these errors, transport network safety managers should be applying the current state of the practice methods for hotspot detection. Moreover, transport network safety managers should be eager to transition to proactive methods of network safety management to avoid the need for crashes to occur. While in its infancy, the use of surrogate measures of safety holds significant promise for the future. © 2018 by Emerald Publishing Limited All rights of reproduction in any form reserved.","Cited By :4

By harvesting real-time tweets and clustering tweets within suburbs and skyscrapers, we show how micro-populations can be calculated. To validate this, we construct linear and spatial models for the suburbs in four cities of Australia using census data and geospatial data models (shapefiles). Our prediction of micro-population shows that Twitter can indeed be used for population prediction with a high degree of accuracy. © 2017, Springer-Verlag Wien.","Cited By :6

Recent research, however, has shown that the most common before–after approaches can still provide a biased estimate when an entry criterion is used and when the characteristics of the treatment and control groups are dissimilar. Recently, a new simple method, referred to as the Naïve Adjustment Method (NAM), has been proposed to mitigate the limitations identified above. Unfortunately, the effectiveness of the NAM using ‘real’ data has not yet been properly investigated. Hence, this paper examined the accuracy of the NAM when the treatment group contains sites that have different mean values. Simulated and two observed datasets were used. The results show that the NAM outperforms the Naïve, the Control Group, and the empirical Bayesian methods.

However, the traditional geographic information system for transportation (GIS-T) mostly presents fundamental data and static analysis, and transportation models focus predominantly on some typical road structures. Therefore, it is important to integrate transportation models with the spatiotemporal analysis techniques of GIS to address the dynamic process of traffic incidents. This paper presents a dynamic spatiotemporal analysis model to predict the influence of traffic incidents with the assistance of a GIS database and road network data. The model leverages a physical traffic shockwave model, and different superposition situations of shockwaves are proposed for both straight roads and road networks. Two typical cases were selected to verify the proposed model and were tested with the car-following model and real-world monitoring data. The results showed that the proposed model could successfully predict traffic effects with over 60% accuracy in both cases, and required less computational resources than the car-following model. Compared to other methods, the proposed model required fewer dynamic parameters and could be implemented on a wider set of road hierarchies. © 2017 by the authors.","Cited By :3

One usef ul approach to improve road safety is through the identification of RT A hotspots along a road, so they can be prioritised and treated. This paper introduces an approach based on Geographical Information System (GI S) to identify and prioritise RTA hotspots along a road network using historical RTA data. One particular urban road in Brunei with a historically high rate of RT As, Jalan Gadong, was selected as a case study. Five years of historical RTA data were acquired from the relevant authorities and input into a GIS database. GI S analysis was then used to identify the spatial extension of the RT A hotspots. The RT A hotspots were ranked according to three different schemes: Frequency, severity and socio-economic impact of RTAs. A composite ranking scheme was also developed to combine these schemes; this enabled the prioritisation and development of intervention and maintenance programmes of the identified RTA hotspots. A visualisation method of the RTA spatial distribution within each identified RTA hotspot was also developed to determine the most risky road stretches within each hotspot, which is important for treatment prioritisation when limited resources are available. © 2017 The Authors.","Cited By :11

Considering this situation, it is seen that traffic accidents are mostly human originated and one of the major problems that is negatively affecting life. In this context, many investments and many studies have been performed on the determination of traffic accident black spots to reduce traffic accidents. The current study aimed to get a descriptive model for determining the traffic accident black spots using model-based spatial statistical methods. These methods are Poisson regression, Negative Binomial regression and Empirical Bayesian method. The ultimate goal of this study was to build a model that allowed evaluating all the methods together in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) which is quite widely used nowadays.

The state roads of Turkey were divided into 32,107 sub-segments with the length of 1 km. Based on the study results, 126 sub-segments were determined as traffic accident black spots depending on the method used.

Moreover, the random-parameters model was proved to be statistically superior compared to the fixed-parameters one. This means that the unobserved heterogeneity is not negligible in this case. A model to account for temporal correlations in the data collected from the same tunnel over successive time period, the so-called random-intercept model, was also developed and the trend of accidents over time was captured. However, the model in which both the intercept and the regression parameters are allowed to vary randomly was not found to be statistically superior to the random-intercept model.

Hauer has pointed out that the development of knowledge about the level of safety built into roads has been slow and remains incomplete even today. Based on these observations, this paper asks whether evolutionary theory can contribute to explaining the slow development of knowledge. A key proposition of evolutionary theory is that knowledge is discovered through a process of learning-by-doing; it is not necessarily produced intentionally by means of research or development. An unintentional discovery of knowledge is treacherous as far as road safety is concerned, since an apparently effective safety treatment may simply be the result of regression-to-the-mean. The importance of regression-to-the-mean was not fully understood until about 1980, and a substantial part of what was regarded as known at that time may have been based on studies not controlling for regression-to-the-mean. An attempt to provide an axiomatic foundation for designing a safe road system was made by Gunnarsson and Lindström (1970). This had the ambition of providing universal guidelines that would facilitate a preventive approach, rather than the reactive approach based on accident history (i.e. designing a system known to be safe, rather than reacting to events in a system of unknown safety). Three facts are notable about these principles. First, they are stated in very general terms and do not address many of the details of road design or traffic control. Second, they are not based on experience showing their effectiveness. Third, they are partial and do not address the interaction between elements of the road traffic system, in particular road user adaptation to system design. Another notable fact consistent with evolutionary theory, is that the safety margins built into various design elements have been continuously eroded by the development of bigger and faster motor vehicles, that can only be operated safely if roads are wider and straighter than they needed to be when motor vehicles were smaller and moved slower. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :5

How are safe roundabouts designed? This paper tries to answer these questions on the basis of a before-after safety study of conversions of intersections to 255 single-lane roundabouts in Denmark. The before-after study accounts for long-term accident and injury trends and regression-to-the-mean effects. In order to relate safety effects for cyclists of various roundabout design features it is crucial to split the converted sites by speed limit, because safety effects for both cyclists and other road users of converting intersections to roundabouts depend heavily on speed limits on roads entering the converted sites. If speed limits are 70 km/h or higher then converting intersections to roundabouts have resulted in bicycle safety improvements in Denmark. Results show that diameter and height of central islands and type of bicycle facilities at single-lane roundabouts have considerable impacts on cyclists’ safety. Central island diameters of 20–40 m are safer for cyclists than smaller or larger roundabouts. A central island, which middle is elevated 2 m or more above the circulating lane, is safer for cyclists than single-lane roundabouts with lower central islands. Single-lane roundabouts with separate cycle paths, where cyclists must yield to motorists entering or exiting the roundabout, are safer than roundabouts with cycle lanes. Single-lane roundabouts are safer for cyclists than intersections regardless of speed limits when these roundabouts have high central islands and/or separate cycle paths. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :9

Massive amounts of data of Manhattan from a variety of sources were collected, integrated, and processed, including taxi trips, subway turnstile counts, traffic volumes, road network, land use, sociodemographic, and social media data. The whole study area was uniformly split into grid cells as the basic geographical units of analysis. The cell-structured framework makes it easy to incorporate rich and diversified data into risk analysis. The cost of each crash, weighted by injury severity, was assigned to the cells based on the relative distance to the crash site using a kernel density function. A tobit model was developed to relate grid-cell-specific contributing factors to crash costs that are left-censored at zero. The potential for safety improvement (PSI) that could be obtained by using the actual crash cost minus the cost of “similar” sites estimated by the tobit model was used as a measure to identify and rank pedestrian crash hotspots. The proposed hotspot identification method takes into account two important factors that are generally ignored, i.e., injury severity and effects of exposure indicators. Big data, on the one hand, enable more precise estimation of the effects of risk factors by providing richer data for modeling, and on the other hand, enable large-scale hotspot identification with higher resolution than conventional methods based on census tracts or traffic analysis zones. © 2017 Society for Risk Analysis","Cited By :35

Approximately, a quarter of those killed are motorcyclists. The authors carried out a systematic review of the literature to evaluate the effectiveness of interventions to prevent motorcycle crashes and the associated morbidity and mortality. The studies included in this review provide evidence for the effectiveness of helmet use, protective clothing, training, and penalties for alcohol consumption and speeding in preventing injury and death to motorcyclists. The use of helmets is effective, especially if it is universally required by law for drivers and passengers. Training to obtain a license also has positive effects but not when it is totally voluntary. There is limited but consistent evidence that strengthening laws for penalties related to alcohol consumption or speeding has an impact on risk. Traffic calming interventions could help reduce crashes in urban areas. In jurisdictions where there is limited regulation or adherence to effective measures, such as the use of helmets, efforts should be directed primarily at expanding such practices. In other areas, efforts can focus on approaches based on alternative effective measures or on more innovative interventions adapted to local conditions. © 2016 Pan American Health Organization.

As such, we depict the design and field evaluation of an in-vehicle DSS, bridging the gap between real world location analytics and in-vehicle warnings. The system was tested in a country-wide field test of 57 professional drivers, with over 170,000km driven during a four-week period, where vehicle data were gathered via a connected car prototype system. Ultimately, we demonstrate that in-vehicle warnings of accident hotspots have a significant improvement on driver behaviour over time. In addition, we provide first evidence that an individual's personality plays a key role in the effectiveness of in-vehicle DSSs. However, in contrast to existing lab experiments with very promising results, we were unable to find an immediate effect on driver behaviour. Hence, we see a strong need for further field experiments with high resolution car data to confirm that in-vehicle DSSs can deliver in diverse field situations. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.","Cited By :24

Mainly in urban areas, most of the people are using cars as transport when they go out. Due to this traffic blockage, there is a rise in road accidents which direction to a ruin of individual human lives. To avoid this we have implemented a scheme which can control the traffic signals automatically in its path way and reduce the amount of traffic congestion at the signal. The ambulance is implemented with embedded system units, which finds the accident spot and delivers the spot to the close by ambulance through GPS. The ambulance guides the traffic lights in the roadway to the hospital and it also checks the next consecutive signal to shorten the time loss. The vehicle unit is equipped with vibration sensor to determine the vibration if it exceeds the level. The embedded unit sense the accident happens and its sends the neighborhood ambulance unit through wireless transmission.

The spatial distribution characteristic of an accident follows a probability density function (PDF) that can be estimated with parametric functions. Estimating the PDF of accidents can help road specialists recognise accident-prone locations and improve road safety through countermeasures. In this study, the PDF of accidents is estimated using Gaussian mixture models. Gaussian models possess local and density information about accident distributions. For the prediction step, the parameters of the Gaussian models are predicted by means of a recursive least-squares approach. The major feature of this study is that the proposed model can accurately predict physical points where accidents are more likely to take place in the upcoming year. Moreover, because of the non-stationary feature of accidents, the proposed model is online, implying that it would update itself annually. The range of errors obtained from the results of cross-validation with existing data provides a very good indication of the accuracy of the proposed model. © 2017, Thomas Telford Services Ltd.

According to numerous real vehicle experiments, it can be found that there is a good correlation between the driving speed and road conditions perceived by drivers' vision. These road conditions are divided into the drivers' visual lane information and visual roadside information. The drivers' visual lane model fitted by the Catmull-Rom spline could represent the geometric characteristics of low-grade highways obtained from drivers' perception. The back-propagation neural network optimized by the genetic algorithm (GABP) was used to establish the geometric speed model based on the shape parameters of the drivers' visual lane model. Meanwhile, the roadside driving speed correction model was presented by the logistic regression model on the basis of roadside information. These models were combined to form a low-grade highway driving speed prediction method from drivers' visual perception. The driving speed computed with this method agrees well with the measured data, which can well describe the behavioral characteristics that drivers determine driving speeds through their visual perception in the low-grade highway environment. It is an effective method for the driving speed forecast calculation on low-grade highways, which can not only serve as a basis for the evaluation of road safety, but also provide a strong support for the highway geometric design based on the driving speed. © 2017, Editorial Department of Journal of Tongji University.

This allowed the authors to develop a novel black spot–searching algorithm (inspired by some data mining techniques), based on the GPS coordinates of accidents. The authors have implemented it as a web service, and the practical experience shows that it performs very well, especially in built-up areas.

Nowadays, tackling with the accident prone locations including the definition, identification, and modification prioritization has attracted attention as an approach to enhance and improve the roads network safety level. A road accident analysis method is through the use of the Geographic Information System (GIS) and spatial and temporal patterns in accident prone locations. Since accidents are temporal phenomena, in this paper, GIS-based spatial statistical methods have been used to identify and model accident hot spots; in other words, we have investigated the use of localization patterns and hot spot distribution with the help of temporal information.Hot spot analysis with identification and data generation helps decision makers to take appropriate measures to decrease road accidents. To specify and analyze accidents distribution, the information regarding the accidents in the roads of Ilam Province (Iran 2013), has been investigated. Information included the accident type (fatality, injury).From the hot spot map, it is concluded that in northwest roads, despite less traffic, the number (spatial weight) of fatalities is more.This can be due to such factors as the route geometrical design, lack of appropriate relief, and so on. To identify the temporal patterns and accidents distribution, and also analyze the hot spots, Moran's method of spatial autocorrelation and Getis-OrdGi∗statistic have been used. © 2017 The Authors.

The multitude of factors responsible for causing an accident, acting solitary or in combination, include road, driver, vehicle, and environment characteristics. As such, the accident analysis process assumes complexity in deciding the perceived domain, and relative importance of the influencing factors. This paper presents a method to simplify this complexity by use of analytic hierarchy process (AHP). Once this is done, AHP is further applied to identify the most hazardous ones, called the black spots. The methodology is demonstrated by taking a case study of a National Highway in India (NH-52, Sikar-Reengus), whereby, the identification of accident black spots, and further investigation is done so as to be able to suggest improvements. Geographic information system (GIS) is used for spatial visualization of the accident data. Four accident black spots are identified.

A safe and comfortable cycling environment is critical to encourage bicycle trips because cyclists are usually subject to greater safety risks. Engineering approaches to road safety management have traditionally addressed road safety by reacting to existing collision records. For bicycle collisions, which are rare events, a proactive approach is more appropriate. This study described the use of bicycle-related macrolevel (i.e., neighborhood or zonal-level) collision prediction models as empirical tools in road safety diagnosis and planning. These models incorporated an actual bicycle exposure indicator (the number of bicycle kilometers traveled). The macrolevel bicycle-vehicle collisions models were applied at the zonal level to a case study of Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. Collision-prone zones in Vancouver were identified, and the highest-ranked zones were diagnosed to identify bicycle safety issues and to recommend potential safety countermeasures. The findings from this study suggest that the safety issues may be a result of high density and commercial land use type, coupled with a high traffic volume, particularly on arterial routes, and high bicycle volumes on routes with mixed vehicle and bicycle traffic. The case study demonstrated the use of the models to enhance bicycle safety proactively.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

According to the relationship between vehicle bypass decision-making index and threshold under accident condition, the vehicles’ route choice behavior at upstream of the accident spot can be divided into two types: bypass and nonbypass. Under nonbypass condition, the method of using traffic wave theory was put forward to determine the upstream influence area. Under bypass condition, the total number of bypass vehicles is determined based on bypass decision-making index being greater than bypass threshold. Assignment algorithms based on routes were proposed. Using improved Logit model to get the selection probability and the traffic flow of each route, then traffic flow of surrounding links could be obtained. At last, the road network influenced by the accident could be determined by comparing with the level of service of each link under normal condition. The paper takes Beijing-Kunming highway as an example, and the results show that the road network formed by the influenced links was highway traffic accident influence area. Comparing with the actual survey results, correctness of the calculation method is verified. Therefore, the analytical method based on bypass decision-making is applicable to determining highway accident influence area. © 2017 Zhenjun Zhu et al.","Cited By :1

In particular, coastal areas experience intense pressure from developers with respect to settlements, tourism, trade and industry, and built-up areas are being observed near coasts. The inability to direct development and control growth is destroying natural resources in coastal areas at a rapid pace. Thus, determining these trends is the key component for ensuring the protection of natural resources and planned growth. Because a complete estimation of urban expansion is not possible, likely changes can be determined using simulations. In this study, a 30-year urban expansion simulation (2004-2034) was obtained using land use/land cover (LU/LC) data for 1987 and 2004 at Samsun (Turkey) coastal areas and using the Cellular Automata-Markov Chain (CA-Markov) method. To verify the method, urban expansion simulation for the year 2014 was compared with real LU/LC data for the same year, and the kappa value was found to be 0,82. To determine LU/LC, Landsat TM/ETM+/OLI satellite images were used, and the analyses were realised in a geographic information system (GIS) environment. As a result of the study, the CA-Markov Chain approach integrated with GIS and remote sensing was shown to be effective in the study of urban growth dynamics. Using the simulation for the year 2034, probable urban expansion in the 2014-2034 period was estimated as approximately 3683 ha and the probable destructions of absolute agricultural lands, forests and pastures were predicted as approximately 968 ha, 228 ha and 24 ha, respectively. © 2017, Strojarski Facultet.

This study presents a new HSID method using the quantitative risk assessment (QRA) technique. Crashes that are likely to happen for a specific site are treated as the risk. The aggregation of the crash occurrence probability for all exposure vehicles is estimated based on the empirical Bayesian method. As for the consequences of crashes, crashes may not only cause direct losses (e.g., occupant injuries and property damages) but also result in indirect losses. The indirect losses are expressed by the extra delays calculated using the deterministic queuing diagram method. The direct losses and indirect losses are uniformly monetized to be considered as the consequences of this risk. The potential costs of crashes, as a criterion to rank high-risk sites, can be explicitly expressed as the sum of the crash probability for all passing vehicles and the corresponding consequences of crashes. A case study on the urban expressways of Shanghai is presented.

In recent years, the number of studies about the tools for analysing accidents and road design has increased considerably. Among these tools, Geographical Information Systems (GIS) stand out for their ability to perform complex spatial analyses. However, sometimes the GIS, has been used only as a geographical database to store and represent data about accidents and road characteristics. It has also been used to represent the results of statistical studies of accidents but, these statistical studies have not been carried out with GIS. Owing to its integrated statistical-analysis capabilities GIS provides several advantages. First, it allows a more careful and accurate data selection, screening and reduction. Also, it allows a spatial analysis of the results in pre and post-processing. Second, GIS allows the development of spatial statistics that rely on geographically-referenced data. In this paper, several GIS tools used to model accidents have been examined.

Numerous studies addressed the effectiveness of light-reflecting devices in reducing collisions with animals in past decades, but yielded contradictory results. In this study, we conducted a systematic literature review to investigate whether light-reflecting devices contribute to an effective prevention of animal-vehicle collisions. We reviewed 53 references and reanalyzed original data of animal-vehicle collisions with meta-analytical methods. We calculated an effect size based on the annual number of animal-vehicle collisions per kilometer of road to compare segments with and without the installation of light-reflecting devices for 185 roads in Europe and North America. Our results indicate that light-reflecting devices did not significantly reduce the number of animal-vehicle collisions. However, we observed considerable differences of effect sizes with respect to study duration, study design, and country. Our results suggest that length of the road segment studied, study duration, study design and public attitude (preconception) to the functioning of devices may affect whether the documented number of animal-vehicle collisions in- or decrease and might in turn influence whether results obtained were published. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :11

Road accident data for a period of 2–6 years on different sections of 8 National and State Highways in Haryana was collected from police records. Data related to road geometry, traffic and road environment related variables was collected through field studies. Total two hundred and twenty two data points were gathered by dividing highways into sections with certain uniform geometric characteristics. For prediction of accident frequencies using fifteen input parameters, two modeling approaches: FENB/RENB regression and M5 model tree were used. Results suggest that both models perform comparably well in terms of correlation coefficient and root mean square error values. M5 model tree provides simple linear equations that are easy to interpret and provide better insight, indicating that this approach can effectively be used as an alternative to RENB approach if the sole purpose is to predict motor vehicle crashes. Sensitivity analysis using M5 model tree also suggests that its results reflect the physical conditions. Both models clearly indicate that to improve safety on Indian highways minor accesses to the highways need to be properly designed and controlled, the service roads to be made functional and dispersion of speeds is to be brought down. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :25

Current measures are mostly based on crash frequency. This article proposes a performance measure based on crash severity, namely, the crash factor measure (CFM). In this article, the performance measures are classified broadly by crash frequency and crash severity. The crash severity measures, the CFM, the equivalent property damage only (EPDO), and the Empirical Bayes supplemented with crash severity (EBCS), and the crash frequency measures, the crash rate (CR) and the Empirical Bayes (EB) are evaluated using eight tests based on empirical and simulated data.

The results from the evaluation demonstrate that the EB and CFM measures performed consistently and are recommended for use. Based on inconsistent results, the CR measure is not recommended for HSID.

Despite the steady progression of methodological innovations in the crash analysis field, many fundamental issues have not been completely addressed. For instance: Is it better to use parsimonious or fully specified models? How should the goodness-of-fit of the models be assessed? Is it better to use a general model for the entire sample or specific models based on sample stratifications? This paper investigates the above issues by means of several SPFs developed using negative binomial regression models for two-lane rural highways in Spain. The models were based on crash data gathered over a 5-year period, using a broad number of explanatory variables related to exposure, geometry, design consistency and roadside features. Results show that the principle of parsimony could be too restrictive and that it provided simplistic models. Most previous studies apply conventional measurements (i.e., R2, BIC, AIC, etc.) to assess the goodness-of-fit of models. Seldom do studies apply cumulative residual (CURE) analysis as a tool for model evaluation. This paper shows that CURE plots are essential tools for calibrating SPF, while also providing information for possible sample stratification. Previous authors suggest that sample segmentation increases the model accuracy. The results presented here confirm that finding, and show that the number of significant variables in the final models increases with sample stratification. This paper point out that fully models based on sample segmentation and on CURE may provide more useful insights about traffic crashes than general parsimonious models when developing SPF. © 2016 Elsevier Ltd","Cited By :19

Compared with the emerging Bayesian spatial and temporal approach, the Bayesian spatio-temporal interaction model contributes to a detailed understanding of differential trends through analyzing and mapping probabilities of area-specific crash trends as differing from the mean trend and highlights specific locations where crash occurrence is deteriorating or improving over time. With traffic analysis zones (TAZs) crash data collected in Florida, an empirical analysis was conducted to evaluate the following three approaches for hotspot identification: FB ranking using a Poisson-lognormal (PLN) model, FB ranking using a Bayesian spatial and temporal (B-ST) model and FB ranking using a Bayesian spatio-temporal interaction (B-ST-I) model. The results show that (a) the models accounting for space-time effects perform better in safety ranking than does the PLN model, and (b) the FB approach using the B-ST-I model significantly outperforms the B-ST approach in correctly identifying hotspots by explicitly accounting for the space-time variation in addition to the stable spatial/temporal patterns of crash occurrence. In practice, the B-ST-I approach plays key roles in addressing two issues: (a) how the identified hotspots have evolved over time and (b) the identification of areas that, whilst not yet hotspots, show a tendency to become hotspots. Finally, it can provide guidance to policy decision makers to efficiently improve zonal-level safety. © 2016 Published by Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :61

Reducing traffic accidents requires an exact understanding of the risk factors associated with traffic patterns and behaviors. Properly analyzing these factors calls for a comprehensive system for collecting and processing accident data. Objectives: The aim of this study was to develop a minimum data set (MDS) for an information management system to study traffic accidents in Iran. Materials and Methods: This descriptive, cross-sectional study was performed in 2014. Data were collected from the traffic police, trauma centers, medical emergency centers, and via the internet. The investigated resources for this study were forms, databases, and documents retrieved from the internet. Forms and databases were identical, and one sample of each was evaluated. The related internet-sourced data were evaluated in their entirety. Data were collected using three checklists. In order to arrive at a consensus about the data elements, the decision Delphi technique was applied using questionnaires. The content validity and reliability of the questionnaires were assessed by experts’ opinions and the test-retest method, respectively. Results: An (MDS) of a traffic accident information management system was assigned to three sections: a minimum data set for traffic police with six classes, including 118 data elements; a trauma center with five data classes, including 57 data elements; and a medical emergency center, with 11 classes, including 64 data elements. Conclusions: Planning for the prevention of traffic accidents requires standardized data. As the foundation for crash prevention efforts, existing standard data infrastructures present policymakers and government officials with a great opportunity to strengthen and integrate existing accident information systems to better track road traffic injuries and fatalities. © 2016, Iranian Red Crescent Medical Journal.","Cited By :7

The basic accident prediction models and the modification coefficients of alignment indexes were obtained, a set of IHSDM accident prediction improved models were built to carry out the sensitivity analysis of alignment indexes, the effects of alignment indexes on the predicted accident rates were explained, and the safe value ranges of alignment indexes for freeways were obtained. Analysis result shows that the accident numbers predicted by IHSDM are lower than the actual accident number, the least error is 13%, and the maximum error is 52%. The relative error between total accident number predicted by the improved model and the actual value is less than 10%. At specific road sections, Pearson's correlation coefficients are 0.60 at least, the root mean square errors are less than 0.30, and the mean relative errors are less than 30%. The sensitivities of accident rates to alignment indexes from high to low are straight line length, longitudinal slope, horizontal curve angle, horizontal curve radius and vertical curve radius.

Fatal road accidents (FRA) in the region of Crete were used for the application of spatio-temporal statistics and prediction models. Fatal road accidents were selected as an example because they are a major public health problem worldwide, that presenting a dramatic increase during times of economic crisis. METHOD A spatio-temporal study was made using primary data from the database of the National Emergency Center for the period 2001–2012, after securing the relevant permission. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS), version 20.0 and the Arc map 10 were used for the analysis (conventional and spatial statistics) with a level of significance of 0.05. RESULTS A greater number of FRA occurred in the densely populated regions in and near the county capitals, mainly Heraklion and Chania. The coastal road axis of the southern parts of the counties accumulated a greater number of FRA, particularly during the months of June, August and September. The general incidence rate of FRA was 610.9/100,000. The expected number of FRA per 50 km2 is higher in the municipalities of Heraklion and Platania (5.5/50 km2) and lower in the municipalities of Kandanou (0.0001/50 km2) and Viannou (0.008/50 km2).

Accident and traffic volume data are gathered for motorway sections from both countries. Safety ranking is made using two conventional indicators, absolute number of accidents and accident rate. A more sophisticated ranking using the Empirical Bayes method is applied. Expected average crash frequency with Empirical Bayes adjustment is calculated. Based on the estimation of the crash frequency, the Critical Crash Rate (CCR) was added to identify and rank black spots. This additional performance measure is able to take into account traffic volume as required by the EU Directive. Results of the Empirical Bayes method are compared with the conventional procedures.

Spatial autocorrelation analysis was performed to show whether the provinces with high mortality rates show clustering. Using spatial autocorrelation analysis the spatial distribution of provinces with high mortality rates was found to be non-random and to be clustered with a significance of p < 0·05. Factor analysis was carried out using population, population density, number of vehicles, number of vehicle-kilometres, number of passenger-kilometres and number of ton-kilometres. The results show that mortality rates based on the number of RTAs are higher in undeveloped provinces compared with developed provinces, and that mortality rates based on the length of roads are higher in developed provinces than in undeveloped provinces. © 2015 ICE Publishing: All rights reserved.","Cited By :5

Simultaneously the concept of sustainable development has become a key element in many strategic and operational policies-including the road sector ones. However, considering the design stage of road infrastructure, there are almost no methodologies that both quantify the road safety performance of the project and consider its economic and environmental nature. This study seeks to develop a preventive evaluation model based on a multicriteria decision analysis. It would allow designers to assess the safety performance and to evaluate some of the economic and environmental impacts of their road projects at the design stage. For this purpose, we have defined a set of 13 criteria which describe the problem. The aim of this paper is to highlight the added value and limits of such an approach. A case study is analysed in order to quantify these arguments. In particular, we apply the PROMETHEE-GAIA method to our problem and we conduct a sensitivity analysis to prove the interest of using a multicriteria decision technique in the context of road designing. A brief presentation of the current and future developments introduces the notion of Pareto frontier and its characterization with a genetic algorithm. Finally, the conclusion and discussion point out the possibilities and impossibilities of this research. © 2015 Editorial Board EJTIR. All rights reserved.","Cited By :8

The ambulance is controlled by control unit which gives the shortest path for reaching hospital and controls traffic lights. The sensor senses the spot and the nearest ambulance reaches the accident spot. The traffic lights in the path of the ambulance are controlled. The ambulance is guided to hospital by server through shortest route.

The flyover facilitates the traffic flow in the directions of the bridge, but the infrastructure cannot fully solve all of the problems especially on the secondary road. Under the bridge, although it relieves the traffic congestion at the intersection; the traffic signal still uses the same control as the “before” situation, that is the fixed time control plan. With the flyover bridge in place, it was found that about 30-35% of all traffic volumes diverted to the bridges, and time delay reduced by 30% over the same period. This paper which is one part of the first author’s thesis, presents the issues that still exist at the flyover-improved junction and makes suggestions to increase the benefits of the flyover such as creating a new cycle and phase times and improving the physical area under the bridge. The SIDRA software is used to determine the appropriate fixed time plans, and using the process of Road Safety Inspection (RSI) to audit the safety of the site and presents the improvements to the remaining problems. © 2014, ENGINEERING JOURNAL.All right reserved.","Cited By :5

Transport and traffic accidents are the examples chosen here. At the same time, Melbourne has been named the world's most liveable city, but this city continues to face challenges caused by the continuous population growth and the issues facing the transport systems caused by increased traffic volumes. This has implications for road safety. The Victorian government has implemented a transportation accident black spot programme however this information is largely historic in nature and does not capture real time traffic accidents. We have designed a Cloud-based software system that correlates historic accident black spot information with Twitter and uses this to benchmark the accuracy of Twitter for identifying and verifying the location of traffic accident black spots.

In road safety, it is crucial to identify the high risk locations to apply proper counter measures. This paper aims at introducing outcomes of a pilot project whose main goal is to develop a GIS based crash analysis system integrated with the quantitative methods for identification of high risk locations on road networks in Turkey. In this concept, traditional hotspot detection methods used in Turkey(crash frequency, rate, and severity) are compared with the spatial statistical methods including Moran‟s I, GetisOrd G and planar and network kernel density estimation in terms of their sensitivity to spatial characteristics of crash clusters. Many countries use traditional hotspot detection approaches such as crash frequency, crash rate, and crash severity as well as Turkey. In this project, we aimed at obtaining a model including different hotspot identification methods for the safety program of Turkey. In order to obtain the model, many hotspot detection methods will be used and compare stage by stage. In the first stage, the seven methods mentioned above are used and examined. Although some of these methods are compared in couple, there is no study using all these methods together extensively in the literature. Methods validated with a different spatial vantage points. Repetitiveness of hotspots in a seven years period are used to compare the methods. Meanwhile advantages and disadvantages of the methods according to location of hotspots are examined additionally. Results show that using planar KDE with Gi in the junction locations and using planar KDE with Moran‟s I in the straight road locations could improve the model while determining hotspots. © 2015 Universidade Federal do Parana.

Using disaggregate crash history information, this method estimates probabilities of crash severities by the major contributing factors using severity models. These probabilities are used to compute expected numbers of severe and fatal crashes at various locations which are then used to classify the locations into two fuzzy cluster, namely hotspot and non-hotspot using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) algorithm. The identified hotspots are ranked based on their mean departure from the core of the hotspot cluster. These rankings are compared with rankings done using existing techniques namely CF, FCF, EPDO, and Empirical Bayes’ (EB).

This study aimed to detect spatial cluster pattern and identify riskier road segments (RRSs) of TC constrained by network with a two-step integrated method, called NKDE-GLINCS combining density estimation and spatial autocorrelation. The first step is novel and involves in spreading TC count to a density surface using Network-constrained Kernel Density Estimation (NKDE). The second step is the process of calculating local indicators of spatial association (LISA) using Network-constrained Getis-Ord Gi* (GLINCS). GLINCS takes the smoothed TC density as input value to identify locations of road segments with high risk. This method was tested using the TC data in 2007 in Wuhan, China. The results demonstrated that the method was valid to delineate TC cluster and identify risk road segments. Besides, it was more effective compared with traditional GLINCS using TC counting as input. Moreover, the top 20 road segments with high-high TC density at the significance level of 0.1 were listed. These results can promote a better identification of RRS, which is valuable in the pursuit of improving transit safety and sustainability in urban road network.

First, a literature review is conducted, which results in a well-structured overview of the existing methodologies from over the world to identify high-risk road locations. In most studies concerning the identification of high-risk locations two important phases can be distinguished. In the first phase a safety indicator has to be calculated. Subsequently it is investigated whether the value of this safety indicator significantly exceeds a predetermined threshold value in the second phase. After the theoretical discussion of these two phases, a new geographic information system (GIS)-based tool is being developed, with which high-risk road locations can be identified and geographically visualized. In a case study of the E313 highway in Flanders three accident indicators are calculated: the accident density, the accident risk, and the expected number of accidents on the basis of an accident model (empirical Bayes approach). Thereafter, priority sites will be determined for each approach.

Many research studies have focused solely on identifying the key factors that cause road crashes. From these studies, it emerged that human factors have the most relevant impact on accident severity. More specifically, accident severity depends on several factors related directly to the driver, i.e., driving experience, driver's socio-economic characteristics, and driving behavior and attitudes. In this paper, we investigate driver behaviors and attitudes while driving and specifically focus on different methods for identifying the factors that most affect the driver's perception of accident risk. To this end, we designed and conducted a survey in two different European contexts: the city of Cosenza, which is located in the south of Italy, and the city of Granada, which is located in the south of Spain. Samples of drivers were contacted for their opinions on certain aspects of driving rules and attitudes while driving, and different types of questions were addressed to the drivers to assess their judgments of these aspects. Consequently, different methods of data analysis were applied to determine the aspects that heavily influence driver perception of accident risk. An experiment based on the stated preferences (SP) was carried out with the drivers, and the SP data were analyzed using an ordered probit (OP) model. Interesting findings emerged from different analyses of the data and from the comparisons among the data collected in the two different territorial contexts. We found that both Italian and Spanish drivers consider driving in an altered psychophysical state and violating the overtaking rules to be the most risky behaviors. © 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

With the recent advances in data collection, storage, and archival methods, the size of accident data sets has grown significantly. This result in turn has motivated research on applying data mining and complex network analysis algorithms to traffic accident analysis; the data mining and complex network analysis algorithms are designed specifically to handle data sets with large dimensions. This paper explores the potential for using two such methods-namely, a modularity-optimizing community detection algorithm and the association rule learning algorithm-to identify important accident characteristics. As a case study, the algorithms were applied to an accident data set compiled for Interstate 190 in the Buffalo-Niagara, New York, metropolitan area. Specifically, the community detection algorithm was used to cluster the data to reduce the inherent heterogeneity, and then the association rule learning algorithm was applied to each cluster to discern meaningful patterns within each, related particularly to high accident frequency locations (hot spots) and incident clearance time. To demonstrate the benefits of clustering, the association rule algorithm was also applied to the whole data set (before clustering) and the results were compared with those discovered from the clusters. The study results indicated that (a) the community detection algorithm was quite effective in identifying clusters with discernible characteristics, (b) clustering helped unveil relationships and accident causative factors that remained hidden when the analysis was performed on the whole data set, and (c) the association rule learning algorithm yielded useful insight into accident hot spots and incident clearance time along I-190.","Cited By :15

Improper geometric design and signal settings at signalized intersection will increase occurrence of conflicts between road users and results in a reduction of the safety level. This study established a cellular automata (CA) model to simulate vehicular interactions involving right-turn vehicles (as similar to left-turn vehicles in US). Through various simulation scenarios for four case cross-intersections, the relationships between conflict occurrences involving right-turn vehicles with traffic volume and right-turn movement control strategies are analyzed. Impacts of traffic volume, permissive right-turn compared to red-amber-green (RAG) arrow, shared straight-through and right-turn lane as well as signal setting are estimated from simulation results. The simulation model is found to be able to provide reasonable assessment of conflicts through comparison of existed simulation approach and observed accidents. Through the proposed approach, prediction models for occurrences and severity of vehicle conflicts can be developed for various geometric layouts and traffic control strategies.© 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Speed cameras were found to reduce total crash numbers by about 20%. The effect declines with increasing distance from the camera location. Fatal crashes were found to be reduced by 51%, this result may however be affected by regression to the mean (RTM). Section control was found to have a greater crash reducing effect than speed cameras (-30% for total crash numbers and -56% for KSI crashes). There is no indication that these results (except the one for the effect of speed cameras on fatal crashes) are affected by regression to the mean, publication bias or outlier bias. The results indicate that kangaroo driving (braking and accelerating) occurs, but no adverse effects on speed or crashes were found. Crash migration, i.e.; an increase of crash numbers on other roads due to rerouting of traffic, may occur in some cases at speed cameras, but the results do not indicate that such effects are common. Both speed cameras and section control were found to achieve considerable speed reductions and the crash effects that were found in meta-analysis are of a similar size or greater than one might expect based on the effects on speed. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.

The traffic police RPV’s main task, like other emergency services, is to handle calls-for-service. Emergency services allocation models are generally based on the shortest path algorithm however, the traffic police RPV also handles other roles, namely patrolling to create a presence that acts as a deterrence, and issuing tickets to offenders. The RPVs need to be located dynamically on both hazardous sections and on roads with heavy traffic in order to increase their presence and conspicuousness, in an attempt to prevent or reduce traffic offences, road accidents and traffic congestion. Due to the importance of the traffic patrol vehicle’s location with regard to their additional roles, allocation of the RPVs adheres to an exogenous, legal, time-to-arrival constraint. We develop location-allocation models and apply them to a case study of the road network in northern Israel. The results of the four models are compared to each other and in relation to the current chosen locations. The multiple formulations provide alternatives that jointly account for road safety and policing objectives which aid decision-makers in the selection of their preferred RPV assignments. The results of the models present a location-allocation configuration per RPV per shift with full call-for-service coverage whilst maximizing police presence and conspicuousness as a proxy for road safety. © 2013, Springer Science+Business Media New York.","Cited By :19

City population and vehicle ownership are the two parameters used to develop the model. A case study of Surat city in Gujarat is taken up. Total accident occurred in the city are regressed with population and vehicle ownership. Second model is the urban arterial based accident prediction model. Past accident record of ring road of Surat city shows that there are eight different locations on a ten kilometer stretch of ring road where the accidents took place consistently. These locations are picked up as accident spots. As there are many contributing factors and causes to road accidents. A comprehensive study of road safety found that human error was the sole cause in 57% of all accidents and was a contributing factor in over 90%. Keeping this in view a new term driver-pedestrian index is used to develop this model. Regression function of Microsoft excel is used for model development. Both the models are checked with R-statistics and t-statistics further the models are validated by using statistical goodness of fit (chi square test). Hence these models can be used to predict number of accidents in future subjected to the same geometric standards. Keeping this in mind improvement measures can be taken up by the district authorities.,"Cited By :2

Heart rate was detected by MP150 simultaneously to indicate any variation of stress response ability. Experimental data was analysed using logarithmic regression and relativity analysis. The model between the stress level of this stress system and the training times was established, and the matching training standard was put forward. The results showed that stress response ability was strengthened with the addition of training times.

However, to the best of the authors' knowledge, no extensive research work has been published on application of Adaptive Neuro-fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) on road accident modelling. Therefore, the present paper aims to develop an ANFIS technique for modelling traffic accidents as a function of road and roadside characteristics. To achieve the objective, accident data and road characteristics were collected over a two-year period along the Qazvin-Loshan intercity roadway in Iran. The candidate set of explanatory variables included the Mean Horizontal Curvature (MHC), Shoulder Width (SW), Road Width (RW), Land Use (LU), Access Points (AP), Longitudinal Grade (LG), and Horizontal Curve Density (HCD). The results showed that RW, SW, LU, and AP significantly affected accident frequencies. Using statistical performance indices, the ANFIS model was compared with the Poisson, negative binomial, and non-linear exponential regression models. Based on the comparative results, the proposed model had higher prediction performance than the other three traditional models which has been widely used in the literature. To conclude, the proposed model could be used as a robust approach to handle uncertainty and complexity existed in accident data. In general, ANFIS model can be an effective tool for transportation agencies since intervention decisions and plans aiming at improving road safety depend on the prediction capabilities of a system. © 2013 Korean Society of Civil Engineers and Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.","Cited By :14

Motor vehicle collisions and pedestrian injuries in areas where schools are located are public health problems in Durban. Objective. To evaluate the effect of traffic calming humps on the number and severity of incidences of collisions and injuries in the Chatsworth and KwaMashu residential areas of the eThekwini Municipality. Methods. The evaluation used an observational interrupted time-series study design, with data obtained from the eThekwini Traffic Authority for roads constituting the routes to 34 schools for 2 years prior to and following the implementation of road humps (excluding the intervening year of implementation). A non-probability convenience sample of 19 schools with 39 roads in Chatsworth and 15 schools with 24 roads in KwaMashu was selected. Results. The traffic calming humps improved safety in both areas with respect to the severity of collisions. Serious pedestrian-vehicle collisions (PVCs) dropped by 23% and 22%, while fatal collisions decreased by 68% and 50% in Chatsworth and KwaMashu, respectively. The median annual PVC rate/km of road/year decreased from 1.41 to 0.96 (p=0.007) and from 2.35 to 1.40 (p<0.001) in Chatsworth and KwaMashu, respectively. There was a 1.6% reduction in the median number of fatal or serious PVCs after implementation in Chatsworth (p=0.03) while in KwaMashu, although the number of collisions decreased, the median number increased by 9% (p=0.07). Conclusions. Traffic calming has been shown to be effective in reducing the number of PVCs but needs to be supported by additional measures to further improve the safety of pedestrians.","Cited By :12

Promotion of active transportation should encourage integration of multiple active transportation modes to better reflect people's actual transportation behaviors. © 2013 Fuller et al.; licensee BioMed Central Ltd.","Cited By :42

The application of this methodology was illustrated by five-year's traffic crash data. Firstly, a non-parametric kernel density estimate sketched a model of two dimensional planar accident point spatial distribution. An estimation of the optimal bandwidth for accident distribution density was 115.2 m and subsequently was selected to create a spatial statistical unit on road segment. Then, the spatial statistical units were derived from a GIS-based region-arc topology model as a representation of the urban road network, and the attribute values of crash counts and severity indices were aggregated. Finally, the Globe Moran index was employed to examine spatial distribution clustered pattern of crash data. The local G-statistic was used to identify the clustering of low and high index values and to generate a crash hot spots map. Results of the research indicate that compared with the negative binomial model in modeling the crash frequency, the spatial analysis under integration of accident attribute data with position can not only identify hot spots on road segments (intersections) but also rank hot spots with spatial correlation according to the attribute values. Traffic management department can use the spatial analysis visualized results to locate hot spots and develop further traffic safety decision-making research.","Cited By :2

The addition of recent studies to the meta-analysis and a more thorough investigation of potential moderator variables lead to a slight improvement of the estimated effects of RLC in the previous meta-analysis. The present study found a non-significant increase of all crashes by 6% and a non-significant decrease of all injury crashes by 13%. Right-angle collisions were found to decrease by 13% and rear-end collisions were found to increase by 39%. For right-angle injury collisions a decrease by 33% was found and for rear-end injury collisions a smaller increase was found (+19%). The effects of RLC are likely to be more favorable when RLC-warning signs are set up at main entrances to areas with RLC enforcement than when each RLC-intersection is signposted. The effects of RLC may become more favorable over time, this could however not be investigated empirically. Several results indicate that spillover effects may occur for right-angle collisions, but most likely not for rear-end and other crashes. If spillover effects do not occur for rear-end crashes, which increase at RLC intersection, this would be a positive result for RLC. However, the results seem to be affected to some degree by publication bias and the effects may therefore be somewhat less favorable than indicated by the results from meta-analysis. © 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Diagnosis is designed to identify a dominant or abnormally high proportion of particular collision configurations (e.g., rear end, right angle, etc.) at a target location. The primary diagnosis method suggested in the HSM is descriptive data analysis. This type of analysis relies on, for example, pie charts, histograms, and/or collision diagrams. Using location specific collision data (e.g., collision frequency per collision configuration for a target location), safety engineers identify (the most) frequent collision configurations. Safety countermeasures are then likely to concentrate on preventing the selected collision configurations. Although its real-world application in engineering practice is limited, an additional collision diagnosis method, known as the beta-binomial (BB) test, is also presented as the secondary diagnosis tool in the HSM. The BB test compares the proportion of a particular collision configuration observed at one location with the proportion of the same collision configuration found at other reference locations which are similar to the target location in terms of selected traffic and roadway characteristics (e.g., traffic volume, traffic control, and number of lanes). This study compared the outcomes obtained from descriptive data analysis and the BB test, and investigates two questions: (1) Do descriptive data analysis and the BB tests produce the same results (i.e., do they select the same collision configurations at the same locations)? and (2) If the tests produce different results, which result should be adopted in engineering practice? This study's analysis was based on a sample of the most recent five years (2005-2009) of collision and roadway configuration data for 143 signalized intersections in the City of Saskatoon, Saskatchewan. The study results show that the BB test's role in diagnosing safety concerns in road safety engineering projects such as safety review projects for existing roadways may be just as important as the descriptive data analysis method. © 2012 Elsevier Ltd.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

SafetyAnalyst adopts a form of SPF, known as the simple SPF, that relates crash experience to traffic volume only. It is a flow-only model that is calibrated by using all sites irrespective of their base geometric conditions. Full SPFs, however, relate crash occurrence to roadway geometric characteristics in addition to traffic characteristics. This study compared the simple SPFs provided in SafetyAnalyst with full SPFs in two safety applications: crash prediction performance and identification of high-crash locations. To compare the prediction performance, the simple and full SPFs were estimated with data collected on urban four-lane freeway interchange influence areas in Florida. Models were estimated for both total crashes and fatal and injury crashes. The mean absolute deviance and the mean square prediction error were used to assess and compare the prediction performance of the two models, and the variation in ranking the high-crash locations with each model was also examined. The results showed that the two models yielded very similar performance of crash prediction and network screening. This empirical result supports the use of the flow-only SPF model adopted in SafetyAnalyst, whose development requires much less effort compared with that for full SPFs.","Cited By :7

Current state-of-the-art network screening methods rely on safety performance functions (SPFs) that require traffic volume as an input, but many cities in North America, including the city of Saskatoon, do not collect traffic volume for every intersection and segment within the city limits. Lack of traffic volume data severely restricts the applicability of a SPF-based network screening method. The binomial and beta-binomial tests, however, are formal collision diagnosis tests that can be used as a supplementary tool for screening roadway networks that include roadway segments for which traffic volume data are not available. However, previous studies have applied these two collision diagnosis tests without explicitly defining the particular circumstances that indicate which test is preferable. This study introduces a formal statistical test known as the ""C(α) test"" to determine when there is a need to apply the beta-binomial test instead of the binomial test to screen a roadway network. The study targeted major arterial uncontrolled access segments in Saskatoon using five years (2005-2009) of collision data for the two most frequent collision configurations: (1) rear end, and (2) side swipe same direction collisions. ArcGIS was used to develop collision maps that visually display the screening results.

One of the basic principles of Rose's strategy is that a large number of people exposed to a small risk can generate more cases than a small number exposed to a high risk. Thus, interventions should address the large number of people exposed to the fundamental causes of diseases. Exposure to moving vehicles could be considered a fundamental cause of road traffic deaths and injuries. A global reduction in the amount of kilometers driven would result in a reduction of the likelihood of collisions for all road users.

Phase 1 researched the potential of an innovative community transportation pass design to reduce automobile use and its associated congestion, pollution, and road safety problems in a mid-sized Canadian city, with possible application across Canada and North America. A program similar to ComPASS has been run successfully since the early 1990s in Boulder, Colorado, called the Neighbourhood Eco (NECO) Pass. It is applied to neighbourhoods ranging between 30 and 675 households, where each household pays an annual fee based on a community revenue neutral (CRN) financial model. The keys to a successful program include: 1) local neighbourhood volunteers to coordinate payment collection and pass distribution; 2) the CRN model; and 3) provide more than just a transit pass. Since its inception in Boulder, single occupancy vehicle (SOV) use and greenhouse gas emissions have significantly declined. Phase 1 of the Glenmore ComPASS was conducted to assess whether a 'made-in-Kelowna' ComPASS program was possible, under what design and price conditions, and how it was expected to change travel behaviours. Overall, results of an online survey are promising as a preferred ComPASS design and price has been supported by 73% of residents, with sampling meeting statistical validity tests at a 90% confidence level.","Export Date: 10 May 2021

Parking places are as one of main part of the modern urban transportation system, having the crucial role of removing static traffic from streets, which can cause to reduce streets' parking spots, improve vehicles movement and increase the width of streets indirectly. Allocations of public parking spaces have been done in traditional way by visiting the location until few years ago without considering all effective parameters in allocation of public parking spots. The only parameter that has been considered, being the price of land. Geographic Information System (GIS) takes into account a suitable system for specifying optimum location to develop the public parking space. Using the GIS has the merit of increasing accuracy in comparison with the traditional method. This research presents proper method for locating of public parking place by consideration all effective parameters and by using GIS. The effective parameters have been weighed by AHP method.

There are two traditional evaluation methods for intersection safety analysis. The direct assessment method is based on statistics of traffic accidents and the indirect method is based on the traffic conflict technique. While both methods rely on traffic data collected after intersections are built, this paper presents a method which evaluates the intersection safety during the intersection design stage. In order to develop the model, the influences of model objective factors are analyzed. Based on the analysis results, a main model is developed based on the conflict points and traffic flow, and a correctional model is established according to geometry property and traffic signs. The main model and correctional model are eventually combined for the purpose of real world applications. In the Jiangsu Province Coastal Highway Project, the safety level of service is divided into 4 levels according to the calculated values of the 40 intersections. A safety evaluation and optimization scheme is presented accordingly.

From 1995 to 2009, an average annual decrease of 5.5 % for fatalities compares to a decrease of 4.1 % for seriously injured. In 2008, 70,466 seriously injured casualties resulted in approximately 7.8 billion Euros macroeconomic costs (fatalities: 4.6 billion Euros). Therefore, the absolute numbers as well as the financial outcome indicate a significant need for action.Despite this, to date, relatively little is known about the medical consequences for seriously injured road casualties. This is partly due to a rather wide definition of this patient group: casualties that die within 30 days after the accident are considered as fatalities while all injured cases that do not meet the above mentioned 24h-criterion are considered as slightly injured.Therefore, especially the group of seriously injured encompasses a wide variety of actual injury severities. Next to patients who stay in the hospital to be monitored for only one night, we find cases with most severe injuries that undergo various surgeries and lengthy treatment within the intensive care unit.After leaving the hospital these patients might undergo long term rehabilitation, suffer of chronic pain or even lifelong disabilities. It is therefore a challenge for road safety research to establish concepts that allow a nationwide in-depth analysis of road accidents including seriously and very seriously injured casualties. In the present chapter - after shortly introducing the often applied medical scoring systems for the classification of injury severity - the results of three studies commissioned by BASt are summarized. These studies use various data sources in order to shed a light on the total number of very seriously injured, as well as on the relative development of this number over the past years. Also the hypothesis is tested, whether a possible shift from former fatalities to survivors with very serious injuries can be in part attributed to an improvement in medical care. The studies further give insight into the injury patterns that result from severe road accidents depending on used mode of transport. It is not the objective of the present chapter to present each study in large detail, but to summarize the current state of knowledge for very serious road casualties in Germany and make the according findings accessible to the international road safety community. © 2012 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

We considered intersection-level (traffic estimates, major roads, number of legs) and area-level (population density, commuting travel modes, household income) characteristics in multilevel Poisson regressions that nested intersections in 506 census tracts. Results: There were significantly more injured pedestrians, cyclists, and motor vehicle occupants at intersections in the poorest than in the richest areas. Controlling for traffic volume, intersection geometry, and pedestrian and cyclist volumes greatly attenuated the event rate ratios between intersections in the poorest and richest areas for injured pedestrians (-70%), cyclists (-44%), and motor vehicle occupants (-44%).

To accomplish this objective, accidents’ data of 1990 through 2009 were obtained from Jordan Traffic Institute and other related sources. Results of analysis revealed that Jordan has experienced huge human and economic losses as well as social and emotional negative impacts. Furthermore, the safety policy measures undertaken in 2008, including the intensification of police enforcement and the increase of penalties for excessive speed had an overall positive influence in reducing accidents and fatalities. However, the application of 2007 traffic policy with stiffer penalties was the most effective measure.

Moreover road accidents in the city have been incessant and to bar the loss of life due to the accidents is even more crucial. To implement this we introduce a scheme called AARS (Automatic ambulance rescue system). The main theme behind this scheme is to provide a smooth flow for the ambulance to reach the hospitals in time and thus minifying the expiration. The idea behind this scheme is to implement a ITS which would control mechanically the traffic lights in the path of the ambulance. The ambulance is controlled by the central unit which furnishes the most scant route to the ambulance and also controls the traffic light according to the ambulance location and thus reaching the hospital safely. The server also determines the location of the accident spot through the sensor systems in the vehicle which encountered the accident and thus the server walks through the ambulance to the spot. This scheme is fully automated, thus it finds the accident spot, controls the traffic lights, helping to reach the hospital in time. © 2012 IEEE.","Cited By :16

In order to simplify the analysis and track changes from one accident to another for comparability, an authentic data coding and category analysis methods are developed, leading to data mining rules. To deal with a huge number of parameters, first, most qualitative data are converted into categorical codes (alpha-numeric), so that computing capacity would also be increased. Second, the whole data entry per accident are turned into ID codes, meaning each crash is possibly unique in attributes, called 'accident combination', reducing the large number of similar value accident records into smaller sets of data. This genetical code technique allows us to learn accident types with its solid attributes. The learning (output averages) provides a decision support mechanism for taking necessary cautions for similar combinations. The results can be analyzed by inputs, outputs (attributes), time (years) and the space (streets).

The models were developed using the input parameters of driver's age and gender, the use of a seat belt, the type and safety of a vehicle, weather conditions, road surface, speed ratio, crash time, crash type, collision type and traffic flow. The models were constructed based on 1000 of crashes in total that occurred during 2007 on the Tehran-Ghom Freeway due to the fact that the remaining records were not suitable for this study. The GA evaluated eleven equations to obtain the best one. Then, GA and PS methods were combined using the best GA equation. The neural network used multi-layer perceptron (MLP) architecture that consisted of a multi-layer feed-forward network with hidden sigmoid and linear output neurons that could also fit multi-dimensional mapping problems arbitrarily well. The ANN was applied during training, testing and validation and had 12 inputs, 25 neurons in the hidden layers and 3 neurons in the output layer. The best-fit model was selected according to the R-value, root mean square errors (RMSE), mean absolute errors (MAE) and the sum of square error (SSE). The highest R-value was obtained for the ANN around 0.87, demonstrating that the ANN provided the best prediction. The combination of GA and PS methods allowed for various prediction rankings ranging from linear relationships to complex equations. The advantage of these models is improving themselves adding new data. © 2011 Copyright Vilnius Gediminas Technical University (VGTU) Press Technika.","Cited By :47

The Limehouse Link is therefore interpreted in terms of the car driver's immersive experience of the tunnel, more active constructions of this experience through sensory qualities of sound, representations of the tunnel in different media and art, ways of knowing the history of Limehouse, and, in particular, as a kind of aesthetic experience.

Previously this has been achieved by using a univariate count data or a multivariate count data model (e.g. multivariate Poisson-lognormal) for modelling the number of accidents at different severity levels simultaneously. This paper proposes an alternative method to estimate accident frequency at different severity levels, namely the two-stage mixed multivariate model which combines both accident frequency and severity models. The accident, traffic and road characteristics data from the M25 motorway and surrounding major roads in England have been collected to demonstrate the use of the two-stage model. A Bayesian spatial model and a mixed logit model have been employed at each stage for accident frequency and severity analysis respectively, and the results combined to produce estimation of the number of accidents at different severity levels. Based on the results from the two-stage model, the accident hotspots on the M25 and surround have been identified. The ranking result using the two-stage model has also been compared with other ranking methods, such as the naïve ranking method, multivariate Poisson-lognormal and fixed proportion method. Compared to the traditional frequency based analysis, the two-stage model has the advantage in that it utilises more detailed individual accident level data and is able to predict low frequency accidents (such as fatal accidents). Therefore, the two-stage mixed multivariate model is a promising tool in predicting accident frequency according to their severity levels and site ranking. © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :85

To support this structurally, a part of these roads have also received additional physical measures in a so-called ""low cost design"" that is expected to reduce the number of traffic casualties by 10-20%. This measure has been implemented as much as possible in an area oriented way. To measure the design's effectivity, road safety in 20 specific rural areas was studied for 5 years before changes were implemented and, on average, 3.5 years thereafter. The study examined 851 km of roads, and a control study was done on 2105 km of comparable roads with a speed limit of 80 km/h. Both the study and the control roads are managed by water boards. Results show that the measures implemented on the roads in the 60 km/h-zones had statistically significant effects (p < 0.05) on casualty accidents (-24% overall), especially at intersections (-44%). This high reduction is probably caused by the concentration of technical interventions at intersections. Both outcomes are somewhat higher than previously expected and are comparable with the outcome of a meta-analysis of safety effects on area-wide urban traffic calming schemes. However, the cost-effectiveness ratio of the 60 km/h zones measures (33,000 per prevented KSI-casualty) is much more favourable than the ratio in urban 30 km/h-zones (86,000 per prevented KSI-casualty). © 2011 Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :14

Understanding the mechanism of crash occurrence well and providing effective safety improvement measures is a challenging task that traffic engineers and researchers have to confront. In the past decades, many studies focused on the safety issue of urban road have resulted in numerous of models and methods to quantify the safety effects of geometric, traffic variables, environmental, and human factors on the occurrence of crash at specific locations. The similar concerns on mountainous highway, however, have rarely been performed. This paper presents the details of an investigation aimed at identifying critical geometric factors contributing towards higher crash rate in mountainous highways. The objectives of this research are to (1) demonstrate the relationship that crash occurrence is associated to geometric variables in different ways, (2) inspire the insight regarding causes of occurrence and countermeasure, and (3) provide concrete proposals in improving the current Technical Standard of Highway Engineering. Based on 5426 motor vehicle crashes collected on three freeways (Jingzhu, Chengyu and Shenda) in the mountainous areas of Southeast, Southwest and Northeast China, contributory geometric factors are divided into three categories: including horizontal alignment, vertical alignment and cross section, and then detailed effects of geometric variables (e.g., radius of horizontal curve, angle of deflection, grade, radius of vertical curve, number of lanes and lane width, presence of shoulders and subgrades, etc.) are separately discussed and quantified through the relation with crash rate. Results of this study shows current standard of roadway design has not given full attention to mountainous highways, and geometric design in these regions should involve much stricter requirements of technical parameters, as proposed in this research.","Cited By :13

However older driver serious injury and fatality rates per distance travelled are higher than middle-aged drivers, and crash and injury rates are likely to increase in the coming decades as a result of the ageing population, increased car ownership and overall travel amongst older people. Evidence suggests that contributory factors to this high risk are (for most) frailty, (for some) the high proportion of driving in urban areas, and (for a few) reduced fitness to drive as a result of medical conditions and associated functional limitations. Australasia has recently adopted the 'Safe System' approach which aims to manage vehicles, the road infrastructure, speeds, and the interactions between these components, to ensure that when crashes do occur, crash energies will remain at levels that minimize the probability of death and serious injury. A system which aspires to achieving Safe System objectives cannot ignore the challenges that older road users pose - and will pose - to the transport system. This paper discusses the so-called 'older driver problem', presents crash data and evidence of the impacts of driving location and reduced fitness to drive on crash risk, and recommends countermeasures within the 'Safe System' context, with particular reference to urban road design and operation. © 2010 Elsevier Ltd.","Cited By :19

Data were collected for three groups of sites: treatment group, comparison group, and reference group. The treatment group included 47 sites belonging to two highway classes: an undivided, rural two-lane arterial (RAU2) and a divided, rural four-lane freeway. A total of 225 sites were used to establish a comparison group for the treatment sites based on implementation year for the treatment site and the highway class. The comparison group was used to correct for the confounding factors of history and maturation. Six reference groups were used; they correspond to the two highway classes and three time periods (2000 to 2002, 2001 to 2003, and 2002 to 2004). Collision prediction models developed from the reference groups were used to correct for the regression to the mean and to account for the changes in traffic volumes in the before-and-after periods. Overall, the results showed that shoulder and centerline rumble strips can significantly reduce severe collisions and specific collision types: (a) the installation of rumble strips reduced all injury collisions by a statistically significant 18.0%; (b) shoulder rumble strips reduced off-road right collisions by a statistically significant 22.5%; and (c) centerline rumble strips (RAU2 sites) showed a statistically significant reduction of 29.3% in off-road left and head-on collisions. RAU2 sites with both centerline and shoulder rumble strips showed a statistically significant reduction of 21.4% in off-road right, off-road left, and head-on collisions combined.","Cited By :14

These models often have been used to estimate the number of crashes per unit of time for an entire highway segment or intersection without distinguishing the influence that subgroups have on crash risk. The two most important subgroups identified in the literature are single- and multivehicle crashes. Recently, researchers have noted that two distinct models for these two categories of crashes provide better predicting performance than models that combine both crash categories to predict crashes for an entire facility. Thus, a study was done to determine whether any difference exists in the identification of hot spots when a single model is applied instead of two distinct models. A hot spot (or black spot) is a site with an accident frequency that is significantly higher than expected at some prescribed level of significance. The data used for the comparison analysis were collected on Texas multilane undivided highways for 1997 to 2001. The study shows that modeling single- and multivehicle crashes separately predicts slightly fewer false positives and negatives than modeling them together under a single aggregated model in the hot spot identification process. Thus, it is recommended that separate models be developed for single- and multivehicle crashes for predicting crashes and for identifying hot spots.","Cited By :15

Especially as large-scale and complex indoor space has been developed, it is more important to analyze human behaviors in complicated 3D indoor space to find accident spots or calculate evacuate routes. In order to do that, it is essential to represent topological relationships among the 3D entities in spatial data modeling. So far, topological relationships have been expressed by feature-based data model based on B-rep. However, this data model has some limitations in maintaining topological relationships: complex geometric computations leading inefficiency in maintaining topological consistency, unclear connectivity relationship, and big data volume. Then network-based topological data model based on graph theory was raised to overcome these limitations. In this data model, because topological relationships in complex 3D space is described as a simple network structure using nodes and edges, computational complexity to define adjacency and connectivity relationships is expected to be reduced. For this reason, the network-based topological data model has been believed in more efficient than feature-based data models for 3D spatial analysis with no practical tests yet. In this paper, to verify this general assumption, we perform comparative analysis about efficiencies on spatial queries between two data models through a practical implementation.","Cited By :4

For a better understanding of the effects of accident migration, this study analyzed before and after distributions of traffic accidents to provide an estimate of the influence of possible accident migration on 47 interrupted flows sections in Gyeonggi province in Korea. The finding shows that the distribution is dependent on a section 0.4∼2.0km behind the point of an automated speed camera set up in an urban area considering the results of the homogeneity test. It was also found that rear end collisions increase during ATE operations at intersections. The results indicate that ATE can result in accident migration.

Crash severity was shown for various speed limits, crash types and road surface friction. Data used were from 422 frontal vehicle crashes in Sweden with recorded crash pulses. The findings of the current study showed that the average change of velocity was 4.6 ± 4.1 km/h higher on roads with a 90 km/h speed limit than on roads with a 70 km/h speed limit. The corresponding difference between 90 km/h and 50 km/h speed limit was 7 ± 5.9 km/h. In single vehicle crashes into guardrails, average change of velocity was 6.6 ± 4.1 km/h lower than into ditches, stones and rocks. The corresponding difference for average mean acceleration was 1.2 ± 0.8g. Two vehicle crashes on rural and urban roads with oncoming vehicles, which had an average change of velocity of 31.8 km/h and an average mean acceleration of 8.6g, constituted the crash type with the highest crash severity. There was a significant increase in crash severity for single vehicle crashes with respect to increasing surface friction. This study shows that the average impact severity of crashes depends not only on the struck object itself, but also on the traffic environment in which the crash occurs. In the development of new safety technologies, real-world crash severity data are valuable as input in attempts to predict the safety effect of these systems in various road traffic designs. © 2009 Taylor & Francis.","Cited By :8

But it often becomes the bottleneck of the road network capacity and the traffic accident spot One of the most important gaps in intersection management practices is the lack of mature effective methods for traffic control. Intelligent and actuated control strategies have been developed, however, these are so complex that the effective are not very perfect in practice. Effective control strategy requires an easy and applicable viewpoint. The main goal of this research is to assist in improving the traffic efficiency at intersection by establishing effective and applicable control strategy. In this article, a signal control algorithm is proposed for isolated intersection that based on fuzzy logic and optimizing the phase order of traffic signal. And the vehicle queue length and arriving rate are selected as the control input parameters. Based on the fuzzy logic a Matlab simulation model is established for a four phases intersection. Compared with the conventional fixed time traffic controller, the fuzzy logic controller (FLC) is proved to be useful and effective with the simulation results and have good performance in the average delay of vehicles, and particularly be applicable to over saturated intersection. © 2009 IEEE.","Cited By :3

We found that the speed dispersion of traffic flow on Airport freeway were larger than that on A20 freeway. The comparing results showed that A20 freeway was safer than Airport freeway.

The size and direction of results reported from studies included in the meta-analysis are strongly affected by study methodology. The studies that have controlled for most confounding factors yield the least favourable results. Based on these studies, installation of RLCs leads to an overall increase in the number of crashes by about 15%. Rear-end collisions increase by about 40% and right angle collisions, which are the target crashes for RLC, are reduced by about 10%. All effects are, however, non-significant. Meta-regression analysis shows that results are more favourable when there is a lack of control for regression to the mean (RTM). An interaction is found between control for RTM and control for those spillover effects that result from the tendency of RLCs to affect crash levels in nearby intersections without RLC. In studies controlling for RTM, additional control for spillover effects reduces the favourability of results still further. Studies controlling for both RTM and spillover effects tend also to control for more additional factors than other studies. It is likely that the results are affected by additional moderator variables, which could not be investigated in this meta-analysis. RLCs may reduce crashes under some conditions, but on the whole RLCs do not seem to be a successful safety measure. © 2008 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Cited By :45

Identifying the traffic hot spots of the roads provides the possibility of promoting the road safety which is also related to investigate frequency and intensity of occurred accidents. Accidents are multidimensional and complicated events. Identifying the accident factors is based on applying a comprehensive and integrated system for making decisions. Therefore, applying common mathematical and statistical methods in this field can be resulted in some problems. Hence, the new research methods with abilities to infer meaning from complicated and ambiguous data seem useful. Therefore, along with identifying the traffic hot spots, adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy inference system is used to predict traffic hot spots on rural roads. In this process, a fuzzy inference system from Sugeno type is trained applying hybrid optimization routine (back propagation algorithm in combination with a least square type of method) and accident data of Karaj-Chalus road in Tehran Province. Then the system was tested by a complete set of data. Finally, the stated system could predict 96.85 % of accident frequencies in the studied blocks. Furthermore, the amount of effective false negative in all cases included only 0.82 % of predictions, which indicated a good approximation of predictions and model credibility. © IRSEN.","Cited By :13

It has been revealed in this study that most of the accidents at black spots occurred due to speedy and aggressive driving of road users. Geometric conditions have comparatively less contribution in accidents. Furthermore, most of the accidents happened in broad day light rather than at night. In order to have safe and smooth flow of traffic on urban highways, encroachments within the right of way should be cleared off and separate service roads should be provided for local traffic.

Crash-prediction models focused on multilane rural roads, however, have rarely been investigated. In addition, most research has paid but little attention to the safety effects of variables such as stopping sight distance and pavement surface characteristics. Moreover, the statistical approaches have generally included Poisson and Negative Binomial regression models, whilst Negative Multinomial regression model has been used to a lesser extent. Finally, as far as the authors are aware, prediction models involving all the above-mentioned factors have still not been developed in Italy for multilane roads, such as motorways. Thus, in this paper crash-prediction models for a four-lane median-divided Italian motorway were set up on the basis of accident data observed during a 5-year monitoring period extending between 1999 and 2003. The Poisson, Negative Binomial and Negative Multinomial regression models, applied separately to tangents and curves, were used to model the frequency of accident occurrence. Model parameters were estimated by the Maximum Likelihood Method, and the Generalized Likelihood Ratio Test was applied to detect the significant variables to be included in the model equation. Goodness-of-fit was measured by means of both the explained fraction of total variation and the explained fraction of systematic variation. The Cumulative Residuals Method was also used to test the adequacy of a regression model throughout the range of each variable. The candidate set of explanatory variables was: length (L), curvature (1/R), annual average daily traffic (AADT), sight distance (SD), side friction coefficient (SFC), longitudinal slope (LS) and the presence of a junction (J). Separate prediction models for total crashes and for fatal and injury crashes only were considered. For curves it is shown that significant variables are L, 1/R and AADT, whereas for tangents they are L, AADT and junctions. The effect of rain precipitation was analysed on the basis of hourly rainfall data and assumptions about drying time. It is shown that a wet pavement significantly increases the number of crashes. The models developed in this paper for Italian motorways appear to be useful for many applications such as the detection of critical factors, the estimation of accident reduction due to infrastructure and pavement improvement, and the predictions of accidents counts when comparing different design options. Thus this research may represent a point of reference for engineers in adjusting or designing multilane roads. © 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.","Cited By :203

Model development and subsequently the results are affected by the choice of regression technique. The objective of this paper is to compare two types of regression techniques: the traditional negative binomial (TNB) and the modified negative binomial (MNB). The TNB approach assumes that the shape parameter of the negative binomial distribution is fixed for all locations, while the MNB approach assumes that this shape parameter varies with the location's characteristics. The difference between the two approaches in terms of their goodness of fit and the identification and ranking of accident-prone locations is investigated. The study makes use of a sample of accident, volume, and geometric data corresponding to 392 arterial segments in British Columbia, Canada. Both models appear to fit the data well. However, the MNB approach provides a statistically significant improvement in model fit over the TNB approach. A total of 100 locations were identified as accident-prone by both approaches. A comparison between the ranks showed a close agreement in the general trend of ranking between the two models. While the MNB approach appears to fit the data better than the TNB approach, there was little difference in the results of the identification and ranking of accident-prone locations. This is likely due to the nature of the application and the data set used. The difference in results will depend on the extent to which deviant sites exist in the data set.","Cited By :74

These 'dangerous' accident sites are selected by means of historic accident records for the period 1997-1999. More specifically, a combination of weighting values, respectively 1 for each light injury, 3 for each serious injury and 5 for each deadly injury, is used to calculate the priority score for each accident location. In this paper, a sensitivity analysis is performed to investigate how big the impact is on the current ranking of accident sites when alternative ranking criteria are used. More specifically, we only take into account the most serious injury per accident and use a valuation of casualties based on direct costs, indirect costs and validation for human suffering to give weight to the accidents. This valuation results in the weighting values 1-7-33 when the most severe injury respectively concerns a light, serious or deadly injury. Additionally, we generate probability plots, based on estimates from a hierarchical Bayes model, in order to visualize the estimated probability that a location will be ranked as dangerous. Results showed that combining these ranking criteria will have a big impact on the selection and ranking of dangerous accident locations. In particular, when selecting the 800 most dangerous accident sites of all accident locations, 82% of these locations will differ from the current selection. Considering this impact quantity, we want to sensitise government to carefully choose the criteria for ranking and selecting accident locations without stating that the criterion used in this paper should be preferred to the currently used ranking method. © 2005 WIT Press.","Cited By :2

The literature is replete with the development and discussion of statistical methods for hotspot identification (HSID). Theoretical derivations and empirical studies have been used to weigh the benefits of various HSID methods; however, a small number of studies have used controlled experiments to systematically assess various methods. Using experimentally derived simulated data - which are argued to be superior to empirical data, three hot spot identification methods observed in practice are evaluated: simple ranking, confidence interval, and Empirical Bayes. Using simulated data, sites with promise are known a priori, in contrast to empirical data where high risk sites are not known for certain. To conduct the evaluation, properties of observed crash data are used to generate simulated crash frequency distributions at hypothetical sites. A variety of factors is manipulated to simulate a host of 'real world' conditions. Various levels of confidence are explored, and false positives (identifying a safe site as high risk) and false negatives (identifying a high risk site as safe) are compared across methods. Finally, the effects of crash history duration in the three HSID approaches are assessed. The results illustrate that the Empirical Bayes technique significantly outperforms ranking and confidence interval techniques (with certain caveats). As found by others, false positives and negatives are inversely related. Three years of crash history appears, in general, to provide an appropriate crash history duration. © 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

Furthermore, parallel collisions and accidents on highways or roads with separated lanes, occurring at night or during the weekend are frequently occurring accident patterns for all accident locations.

Road safety audits are concerned with the safety of all road users - motorists, pedestrians, and bicyclists - and are to be conducted for all projects, regardless of size or type. A comprehensive road safety audit was conducted on State Highway 17 in Karnataka in India, which links Bangalore and Mysore. On the basis of the road safety audit, an attempt was made to develop hazard-rating scores for a 23-km stretch of the highway. From the hazard-rating scores, a hazard ratio was also derived; it gives an indication of the safety performance of individual kilometer sections with respect to the overall average. The hazard ratio can hence be used to prioritize the sections in the stretch for improvement to enhance the overall safety of the highway.","Cited By :6

So-called compact roundabouts have proved particularly successful with regard to traffic safety; in many cases it was possible to eliminate accident ""black spots"" by converting existing intersections. Analysis of accident data has shown, however, that safety improvements have not produced satisfactory results at all roundabouts. Indeed, before-and-after comparisons indicate certain roundabouts actually experienced increases in the number of accidents. The causes of these negative effects appear to lie in local circumstances. A research project was launched to investigate the relationships between accident occurrence, traffic flow, and geometry in the area of roundabouts. The goal of the project was to develop basic principles for a Swiss design standard. The central importance in roundabout design of the deflection of vehicle pass-through tracks by means of the roundabout's central island was established. An insufficient deflection of the vehicle stream from the straight direction of travel results in failures to give way, increased pass-through speeds, and underestimations of these speeds by the other parties in conflict situations. These consequences are manifested in increased accident frequency.","Cited By :9

Identification of accident causal factors and prediction of hazardousness are essential tasks before safety treatments can be prescribed and prioritized. Statistical methods were used as a novel method for the identification of causal factors affecting accident frequencies, while nonparametric regression techniques were used for the prediction of intersection approach hazardousness. The statistical methodology used, the random-effect negative binomial model, indicates that uncontrolled left-turn slip roads, sight distances of less than 100 m, large numbers of signal phases, the use of permissive right-turn phases, the existence of horizontal curves, and total and left-turn volumes may increase the likelihood of accident occurrence. By nonparametric regression, the subtractive clustering methodology in fuzzy logic was used to derive an efficient and effective data set from the original data, which exhibited a high level of noise. This clustered data set was used to predict hazardousness. The prediction model, a generalized regression neural network, showed reasonable prediction accuracy. The model was capable of predicting hazardousness of about 65% for the total production data set, with a difference between the actual and the predicted values of less than 0.1. Moreover, the results suggest that the nonparametric regression network works well in multi-dimensional measurement spaces, in which hazardousness is assumed to be a function of several geometric, traffic, and traffic control measures.","Cited By :13

Historically, the safety of new and innovative traffic treatments has been difficult to assess, primarily because of a lack of good predictive models of crash potential and a lack of consensus on what constitutes a safe or unsafe facility. An FHWA-sponsored research project investigated the potential to derive surrogate measures of safety from existing traffic simulation models. These surrogate measures could then be used to support evaluations of various traffic engineering alternatives, including facilities that have not yet been built and strategies that have not yet been used. Each surrogate measure is collected on the basis of the occurrence of a conflict event, which is an interaction between two vehicles in which one vehicle must take evasive action to avoid a collision. The surrogate measures that are proposed as the best are time to collision, postencroachment time, deceleration rate, maximum speed, and speed differential. Time to collision, postencroachment time, and deceleration rate can be used to measure the severity of the conflict. Maximum speed and the speed differential can be used to measure the severity of the potential collision (by use of additional information about the mass of the vehicles involved to assess momentum). After the simulation model is executed for a number of iterations, a postprocessing tool would be used to compute the statistics for the various measures and perform comparisons between design alternatives.","Cited By :216

New major urban roads have statistically insignificant effects on injury incidence. New major roads between towns decrease injuries. Out-of-town bypasses reduce disturbance and community severance in towns but increase them elsewhere. Major urban roads increase disturbance and severance. More robust research is needed in this area, particularly regarding effects of new roads on respiratory health, mental health, access to health services, and physical activity.","Cited By :63

These safety estimates can be used in identifying and ranking accident prone locations, evaluating the effectiveness of remedial measures and in road safety planning. This paper discusses the advantages of using accident prediction models in road safety analysis and describes three applications of these models. The first application relates to the identification and ranking of hazardous intersections in British Columbia. The second describes a safety planning application where accident prediction models for urban arterial roadways are used to investigate the effect of the median type on accident occurrence.

While improvements to vehicle design can reduce the severity of whiplash injuries when a crash occurs, improvements to road safety can prevent whiplash-inducing crashes from occurring in the first place. Whiplash injuries are most commonly associated with rear end crashes. Unfortunately, rear end crashes are also the most common type of crash at urban signalized intersections, where the majority of crashes occur in British Columbia, Canada. The Insurance Corporation of British Columbia (ICBC), through the road improvement program, has been funding road improvements in order to reduce the frequency of collisions at high crash locations in British Columbia. Several road safety engineering countermeasures specifically targeted at rear end collisions have been researched and deployed. These countermeasures include simple and affordable solutions such as signal visibility enhancements, as well as complex and expensive solutions such as intersection geometric upgrades. When appropriately used, these countermeasures have proven to be extremely cost-effective in reducing the frequency of rear end collisions. Widespread application of signal visibility enhancements is now being pursued to further decrease the risk of rear end collisions and whiplash injuries. Costs are the direct cost of the ICBC portion of the investment and benefits are only those associated with reduced insurance claims over a 2-year period. © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd.","Cited By :7

Unlike any other current space-based instrument, OCO-3 has the ability to scan large contiguous areas of emission hot spots like cities, power plants, and volcanoes. These measurements result in dense, fine-scale spatial maps of column averaged dry-air mole fractions of carbon dioxide (XCO2). For the first time, we present and analyze XCO2 distributions over the Los Angeles megacity (LA) derived from OCO-3 SAM and target mode observations. Urban XCO2 enhancements range from 0 - 6 ppm (median enhancements <^> 2 ppm) relative to a clean background and show excellent agreement with nearby ground-based TCCON measurements of XCO2. OCO-3?s dense observations reveal intra-urban variations of XCO2 over the city that have never been observed from space before. The spatial variations are mainly driven by the complex fossil fuel emission patterns and meteorological conditions in the LA Basin and are in good agreement with those from co-located TROPOMI measurements of co-emitted NO2. Differences between measured and simulated XCO2 enhancements from two models (WRF-Chem and X-STILT) are typically below 1 ppm with larger differences for some sub regions. Both models capture the observed intra-urban XCO2 gradients. Further, OCO-3?s multi-swath measurements capture about three times as much of the city emissions compared to single-swath overpasses.

These aspects, previously studied in the literature, are rarely focused on the economic valuation, through which benefits are revealed. This paper evaluates the creation of AGs in a peri-urban degraded agroecosystem in Murcia (SESpain). The values of ES are quantified economically, so are the influences of the socioeconomic and spatial characteristics. A survey was undertaken, from which the willingness to pay (WTP) for owning an AG and the factors influencing the valuation were determined. The results indicate that provisioning services are the ES valued most highly. The valuation of the project for the whole population is 5.4 ?/household/month, with a WTP of 17.2 ?/household/month for owning an AG plot. Multivariate analysis showed the importance of ES and spatial factors in this valuation. This WTP spatial study shows the existence of local patterns to be considered in the evaluation of new AGs location alternatives.

In this context, the unlikely roadsides plantation of nonnative species by the city decision-makers was a short-term solution to cultivate green belts, ultimately, to improve city environment. However, this has backfired and become a very serious ecological crisis as the species become invasive alien species and destroyed the native ecological environment of the city significantly. This study provided an accurate spatial extent of invasive alien species and evaluated the intensity of the problem using remote sensing technology. Firstly, the importance value index was developed to highlight the intensity of invasive alien species in native plant communities. Afterwards, the hot spots were sampled to develop training areas for Object Based Image Analysis to map the extent of invasive alien species in the city using high-resolution GeoEye satellite imagery. The overall accuracy of mapping was 93.17% with Kappa coefficient value of 0.904. In addition, to explore hyperspectral remote sensing analysis, two techniques-Derivative Vegetation Index and Spectral Angle Mapper-were employed on EO-I hyperspectral imagery to map invasive alien species using spectral signatures. The analysis revealed 99.94% correlation between the two mapping techniques. Finally, to identify the impact of invasive alien species on the microclimate of the city, a spatiotemporal analysis (1992-2016) at selected sites was performed on Landsat thermal images. The study ruled out the concept of invasive alien species influence on the microclimate of the city as both vegetation growth and ambient air temperature change were not interdependent.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,Pakistan;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

We address this question by contrasting the spatial patterns of hot (cold) clusters of WTP for improvements in several ecosystem services. We geocoded individual-specific WTP estimates derived from a discrete choice experiment exploring preferences for ecosystem service improvements for three different catchment areas in Scotland comprising urban, agricultural, riverine and estuarine ecosystems. The local Moran's I statistic was used to find statistically significant local clusters and identify hot spots and cold spots. Finally, Multi-type Ripley's K and L functions were used to contrast the spatial patterns of local clusters of WTP among ecosystem services, and across case studies. Our results show that hotspots of WTP for environmental improvements tend to occur close to each other in space, regardless of the ecosystem service or the area under consideration. Our findings suggest that households sort themselves according to their preferences for estuarine ecosystem services.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"",,

Mining it not only can help us better understand the flow pattern of a city, but also provides a new perspective for interpreting the urban structure. On the basis of massive taxi trajectory data in Chengdu, we introduce a network science approach to analysis, propose a new framework for interaction analysis, and model the intrinsic connections within cities. The spatial grid of fine particles and the trajectory connections between them are used to resolve the urban structure.

Five one-step reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) assays, targeting the polymerase (IP2 and IP4), the envelope (E), and the nucleoprotein (N1 and N2) genome regions, were employed for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) RNA detection in 24-h composite wastewater samples concentrated by polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation. SARS-CoV-2 was detected in a sewage sample collected 41 days ahead of the declaration of the first COVID-19 case. The evolution of SARS-CoV-2 genome copies in wastewater evidenced the validity of water-based epidemiology (WBE) to anticipate COVID-19 outbreaks, to evaluate the impact of control measures, and even to estimate the burden of shedders, including presymptomatic, asymptomatic, symptomatic, and undiagnosed cases. For the latter objective, a model was applied for the estimation of the total number of shedders, evidencing a high proportion of asymptomatic infected individuals. In this way, an infection prevalence of 2.0 to 6.5% was figured. On the other hand, proportions of around 0.12% and 0.09% of the total population were determined to be required for positive detection in the two WWTPs. At the end of the lockdown, SARS-CoV-2 RNA apparently disappeared in the WWTPs but could still be detected in grab samples from four urban sewers. Sewer monitoring allowed for location of specific hot spots of COVID-19, enabling the rapid adoption of appropriate mitigation measures.        IMPORTANCE Water-based epidemiology (WBE) is a valuable early warning tool for tracking the circulation of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) among the population, including not only symptomatic patients but also asymptomatic, presymptomatic, and misdiagnosed carriers, which represent a high proportion of the infected population. In the specific case of Barcelona, wastewater surveillance anticipated by several weeks not only the original COVID-19 pandemic wave but also the onset of the second wave. In addition, SARS-CoV-2 occurrence in wastewater evidenced the efficacy of the adopted lockdown measures on the circulation of the virus. Health authorities profited from WBE to complement other inputs and adopt rapid and adequate measures to mitigate the effects of the pandemic. For example, sentinel surveillance of specific sewers helped to locate COVID-19 hot spots and to conduct massive numbers of RT-PCR tests among the population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,Spain,,

Here, on the basis of long-term landslide inventory, multitemporal unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) surveys and field investigations, we examined the spatiotemporal distribution of successive landslides and their evolution characteristics in a typical loess tableland, Gansu Province, China. We found that the hot spots of successive landslides changed during the survey period and the hillslopes around the loess tableland experienced different evolutionary stages. Landslide areas are characterized by lower values of local relief, elevation and slope gradient than non-landslide areas and are more exposed to south, southeast and east orientations. Agricultural irrigation-induced successive landslides are responsible for the recession of the loess tableland area, which accelerates the morphological evolution process of the loess tableland. Under the influence of path dependency, more subsequent landslides may occur in a certain period. Moreover, this influence of earlier landslides on subsequent landslides (i.e., path dependency) will decrease with increasing time intervals (year). Two models (lateral and lengthwise development patterns) summarized in this study can describe the typical evolution processes caused by successive landslides in loess tableland areas.

Besides the diversity of factors involved, there is no consensual framework to develop composite indices, one recognized methodology to deal with a multifaceted issue. Therefore, this research aims to establish a new transferable approach to assess the spatial heterogeneity of territorial inequalities. This new strategy relies on the simultaneous evaluation of resilience and vulnerability and the joint analysis based on the cross-interpretation of the spatialized composite indices of resilience and vulnerability. A case study was conducted to demonstrate the feasibility of this methodology, using the municipality as a spatial unit of analysis within a region in the north of France. To provide the most holistic description possible of the 3817 studied municipalities, 50 variables related to the economic, environment, policy, health, services and social dimensions were used to develop the composite indices. The vulnerability Index has a median value of 0.151 with an IQR [0.126-0.180] and the Resilience Index has a median value of 0.341 with an IQR of [0.273-0401]. The joint analysis was conducted to classify each municipality among four defined typologies: 1687 municipalities (44.2%) belong to the ""To monitor"" category, 1646 (43.1%) to the ""Resilient"" category, 329 (8.6%) to the ""Have resources"" category and 155 (4.1%) to the ""Territorial blackspot"" category. The methodology herein may be a diagnostic tool to identify and prioritize municipalities that could benefit from the implementation of specifically tailored public health policies.

The study revealed that, for the purpose of travel, the modularity and anisotropy rate of the community where the passengers were picked up and dropped off were positively correlated during the morning and evening peak hours and negatively correlated at other times. Depending on the community structure, pick-up and drop-off points reached significant aggregation within the community, and interactions among the communities were also revealed. Based on the type of land use, as passengers' travel activity increased, travel hot spots formed clusters in urban spaces.

Urban hot spots and Urban Thermal Field Variance Index (UTFVI) were used to measure the ecological environment of these cities. Land surface temperature was retrieved from Landsat satellite data using Plank equation, mono-window algorithm (MWA), single-channel algorithm (SCA), and radiative transfer equation. The LST derived using these algorithms was validated with MODIS-LST product. The relationship between LST derived from Landsat 5, 7 and 8 using the four methods and MODIS-LST product was higher with the SCA algorithm (R-2 > 0.75). Land surface temperature was significantly positively correlated with built-up but significantly negatively correlated with vegetation. The surface urban heat intensity was higher during September than January, and it was higher in Ludhiana followed by Bathinda and Balachaur, irrespective of the season. Besides built-up area and population density, soil moisture availability in surrounding rural areas has significant impact on increasing surface urban heat intensity during September than January. The SUCIs were formed in the center of Bathinda city during January 1991, but these were in Ludhiana and Balachaur cities during January 2011. The most critical areas for ecological environment based on UTFVI were identified and the critical UTFVI values (> 0.020) were highest in Bathinda city followed by Balachaur and Ludhiana cities. These results suggest that SUHIs and SUCIs are influenced by seasons and the mitigating plans to counteract the overheating of urban areas should be formulated taking into account soil moisture availability in surrounding rural areas, landscape pattern, seasonal variations, local climatic conditions, urban growth, and development plan etc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,Hot Temperature;Cold Temperature,,

Ibadan North-East, an urban local government area (LGA) within the metropolitan land area of Ibadan, has been experiencing automobile accidents and traffic congestion which in turn limits emergency responders.        Objectives: The broad objective of the study was to develop a digital road network database for emergency response to road traffic accident, Ibadan North East, Nigeria.        Methods: This study made use of primary and secondary data to generate spatial and non-spatial data. ArcGIS 10.3 was used to create the database, analyse data and display the results. Spatial search and network analysis were carried out using a kernel density estimated tool to generate a black-spot area within Ibadan North-East. Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm in the ArcGIS Network Analysis was utilised to identify the closest health facility to the road traffic crash scene.        Results: The most cost-effective haven introduced route impedance and is defined as the best route. Study findings show that dynamic distance varies from the best route to an alternative route. Also, kernel density estimation reveals that crashes widely occur in the northeastern and southwestern parts of Ibadan North-East (Iwo Road and Orita-Aperin). Incorporating live traffic data using GPS technology and traffic cameras was identified to enhance road traffic data documentation and safety.        Conclusion: The study identifies GIS as a decision support system that is useful in the area of planning, mitigation, preparedness, response and recovery for decision-making in road traffic-related emergency management and emergency planning services in Ibadan.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"Accidents, Traffic;Information Systems;Emergencies",,

These threats create environmental hazards, along with urban problems resulting from rapid urbanization and fast growth of cities. Unplanned urbanization causes the formulation of marginalized urban communities. According to a UnHabitat report (2014), those groups are most vulnerable and most likely to suffer from disasters. The vulnerability of such population is an alarming problem with major social, environmental, and economic consequences. This issue has received significant consideration in climate change and disaster management research. The social vulnerability of communities is attributable to multiple indicators such as high levels of poverty, inequality, and problems relating to unemployment, housing, and access to basic civic amenities like safe drinking water and sanitation. This research aims at analysing the social vulnerability of Alexandria city. It reviews and implements several methods for selecting and aggregating vulnerability indicators. This aggregation process that captures multiple aspects of socio-spatial vulnerability in a single index or a small number of variables can produce thematic maps that act as powerful visual tools to identify those areas most susceptible to suffer from environmental changes. This study follows a structured framework to firstly describe the process of developing a social vulnerability index (SoVI), from 14 variables using two different methods. Secondly, it analyses the spatial patterns of the developed composite SoVI at the neighbourhood ``Shyakha"" level using ArcMap geographic information systems (GIS). The results demonstrate that the distribution of social vulnerability is not equal along Alexandria city. Most of the city is categorized to have relatively medium vulnerability level, while few areas are regarded as highly vulnerable ``hot spots"" and other areas are regarded as low vulnerable ``cold spots"". Finally, based on the interpretation of the developed index and the deep examination of the characteristics of those vulnerable areas, the study offers guidelines to promote resilient development of most vulnerable areas.

Results revealed that thefts were highly concentrated in a small percentage of urban basic geostatistical areas. Moreover, a portion of these areas were classified as having the highest deciles of thefts (hot spots) and remained in this group throughout the period.

The resultant increase in temperature is known to amplify global warming, with negative impacts on health and increased energy requirements for cooling. Intra-urban variations in temperature have received less attention than urban-rural variations, although the former can be even larger than the latter. Land cover composition is known to influence surface temperature, while the influence of heights, of buildings and vegetation, is less explored. There are also fewer studies in high-latitude cities although extreme heat events are increasing in frequency and severity in these cities, and high-resolution geospatial datasets are often available for detailed analysis. The aim of this study is therefore to assess the influence of selected land cover variables on the estimated surface temperature in the four largest cities in Denmark-Copenhagen, Aarhus, Odense and Aalborg.        Land surface temperatures (LST) of the four cities were estimated using Band 10 (10.60-11.19 mu m) from Landsat 8 imagery. Vegetation cover, building cover, vegetation height and building height were estimated using 4-band aerial imagery, building footprints and LiDAR-based elevation models, and their correlations with LST were estimated. Moving average filters, with window sizes from 3 x 3 (90 m x 90 m) to 11 x 11 (330 m x 330 m), were used to understand the area of influence of surrounding land cover on the LST within 30-m cells. When vegetation cover and building cover increased from 0-5% to 95-100%, median values of LST decreased by 4.16 +/- 0.76 degrees C and increased by 4.31 +/- 0.69 degrees C, respectively. Land cover variables within 7 x 7 windows (210 m x 210 m) are shown to have strong correlations with the LST of 30-m cells. The area of influence of building heights on the LST of 30-m cells was the largest in Copenhagen, which also has the tallest buildings among the cities. LST reduced by 4.10 degrees C when the mean vegetation height within a 30-m cell increased from 0-2 m to 20-22 m, and by 5.75 degrees C for 210 m x 210 m patches with the same height range. A combination of increased vegetation cover and height could therefore be used to regulate temperature in or close to hot spots in cities depending on the availability of space.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,IMPERVIOUS SURFACE;SPATIAL-PATTERN;HEAT-ISLAND;COVER;CONFIGURATION;IMPACTS;TAMPA;AREA;CITY;Temperature;Vegetables,,

We propose to broaden the research on superspreaders through integrating human mobility data and geographical factors to identify superspreading environment. Six types of popular public facilities were selected: bars, shopping centres, karaoke/cinemas, mega shopping malls, public libraries, and sports centres. A historical dataset on mobility was used to calculate the generalized activity space and space-time prism of individuals during a pre-pandemic period. Analysis of geographic interconnections of public facilities yielded locations by different classes of potential spatial risk. These risk surfaces were weighed and integrated into a ""risk map of superspreading environment"" (SE-risk map) at the city level. Overall, the proposed method can estimate empirical hot spots of superspreading environment with statistical accuracy. The SE-risk map of Hong Kong can pre-identify areas that overlap with the actual disease clusters of bar-related transmission. Our study presents first-of-its-kind research that combines data on facility location and human mobility to identify superspreading environment. The resultant SE-risk map steers the investigation away from pure human focus to include geographic environment, thereby enabling more differentiated non-pharmaceutical interventions and exit strategies to target some places more than others when complete city lockdown is not practicable.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

The results showed that deep tunnels decreased the peak flood volume and shortened the time of peak flow. Pipe network improvements decreased the peak flood volume but did not affect the time of peak flow. However, the deep tunnels could not mitigate local inundations caused by insufficient sewer pipe capacity, whereas pipe network improvements could not mitigate inundations caused by backwater flooding.

This study investigates these issues based on the experience of a large urban police agency that substantially reduced proactive activities across a large area due to resource cutbacks while also shifting a larger share of its declining proactive work into prioritized micro hot spots. Time series models were used to estimate the effects of these changes on crime-related calls in hot spots and non-hot spot areas. Hot spots required higher levels of proactivity (expressed as rates per day or per crime) to control crime, and serious crime rose in these locations following modest reductions in proactivity. In areas outside hot spots, minor and property crimes rose, but only after reductions of one-half to two-thirds in proactive work. Violence was unaffected in these areas, and they did not experience accelerated growth in crime relative to prioritized hot spots. These results help to illuminate minimum levels of police activity that may be necessary to control crime in places of varying risk. They also suggest that police can reduce proactive work by substantial amounts in lower risk areas to place more emphasis on hot spots. Better understanding of these issues is central to widespread, systematic operationalization of hot spot policing as a means to reduce crime across large areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,Calibration,,

National and provincial level studies demonstrate geographic variation in asthma ED visits and links to marginalization, but preclude translation into practical targeting of healthcare delivery. It is important to understand the relationship between pediatric asthma ED visits and marginalization at a more granular level. To map the city-level geographic variation in pediatric asthma ED visit and re-visit rates at the Children's Hospital of Eastern Ontario (CHEO) in Ottawa, Canada and the relationship with marginalization.        Methods: We performed a single center retrospective cohort study of children ages 1-17 with one or more ED visits for asthma at the CHEO in Ottawa. Using postal codes, we linked patients to census tracts. Per census tract, we mapped pediatric asthma ED visit and re-visit rates within one year and identified overlap with the Ontario Marginalization Index.        Results: Of 1,620 children with an index ED visit, 18.5% had a repeat ED visit. We identified 10 hot spot census tracts each for pediatric asthma ED visit and re-visit rates. We identified an overlap between urban hot spots and areas with high ethnic concentration or low dependency.        Conclusion: At a granular, city-wide level, pediatric asthma ED visit and re-visit rates are heterogeneous. Urban hot spots, in contrast to rural, have more overlap with marginalization, especially ethnic concentration. These methods can be used in other jurisdictions to inform practical community strategies for geographically-targeted prevention of pediatric asthma-related ED visits in vulnerable areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,"Canada;Emergency Service, Hospital;Asthma",,

It is gradually becoming the main path that constructs plateau spatial planning of integrating ecological protection, and achieves global sustainable development goals (SDGs) in China. In this paper, the spatio-temporal dynamic evolutions of the ESVs were estimated on the multiple scales of ""basin, subbasin and watershed"" from 1980 to 2015. The main factors influencing ESVs were explored in terms of physical geography, human activities, and climate change. It had been proposed that sustainable spatial planning including ecological protection, basin management, and regional development was urgent to set up. Our results show that the increase in wetland and forest and results in an increase of 9.4% in the ESVs. Attention should be paid to the reduction of water and grassland. Water conservation (WC), waste treatment (WT), and soil formation and conservation (SFC) are the most important ecosystem services in the YZRB. At present, the primary problem is to solve the ESVs decreasing caused by glacier melting, grassland degradation, and desertification in the upper reaches region. The middle reaches should raise the level of supply services. Regulation services should be increased in the lower reaches region on the premise of protecting vegetation. The ESVs in adjacent watersheds are interrelated and the phenomenon of ""high agglomeration and low agglomeration"" is obvious, existing hot-spots and cold-spots of ESVs. Additionally, when the altitude is 4500-5500 m, the temperature is 3-8 degrees C, and the annual precipitation is 350-650 mm, ESVs could reach its maximum. A framework of sustainable plateau spatial planning could provide references to delimit the ecological protection red line, key ecological function zone, and natural resource asset accounting on the QTP.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

Early melting of surface snow leads to exposing the underneath ice mass to sunlight for longer duration and consequent retreat of glaciers. This retreat of glaciers, further cause several hydrological and climatic implications. In this study, efforts were made to perform source apportionment of the LAIs found in the surface snow samples, collected from the three glaciers located in the Indian Western Himalayas (IWHs). Ionic composition of the snow samples derived from ion chromatography was further analyzed using two receptor models viz., principal component analysis (PCA) and positive matrix factorization (PMF). It was observed that biomass burning, vehicular emissions, dust emissions and coal combustion were the major sources of the LAIs in the IWHs. The PMF analysis, estimated that biomass burning and vehicular emissions contributed similar to 30% each in the emission of the LAIs. Hybrid Single-Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT)-based back trajectories for 7-days were plotted to identify locations of the sources of the LAIs. Back trajectories were observed to pass through agricultural, forest-covered and urban areas. The observations made, during this study, would help local authorities in identifying the hot spots of the LAIs'-emissions, on the basis of which region-specific policies could be framed to mitigate the anthropogenic emissions of the LAIs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,India,,

The Version 2 Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications (MERRA-2) provides a series of surface PM2.5 component datasets, including black carbon (BC), organic carbon (OC), and sulfate. We validated the MERRA-2 PM2.5 components by ground-based data from three monitoring sites in Nanjing, China and found there is a good correlation between them. We then used MERRA-2 data to characterize the spatiotemporal distributions of BC, OC, and sulfate concentrations over China from 1980 to 2018. We identified the hot spots of BC, OC, and sulfate pollution in China. Time series analysis shows that BC, OC, and sulfate pollution kept rising before 2007. Then the pollution were suppressed and at a stable level during 2007-2013, and decreased sharply after 2013, which were closely related to air pollution control policies in the last two decades. In addition, a random forest model was developed to preliminarily calibrate the MERRA-2 PM2.5 component data using ground measured PM2.5 components and MERRA-2 meteorological data. Modeling results achieved overall daily cross-validation (CV) R values of 0.85, 0.73 and 0.69 for BC, OC and sulfate, respectively, and the monthly R values reached 0.96, 0.85 and 0.84, which are higher than validation results of original MERRA-2 PM2.5 components.

Outdoor advertisements are the key visual pollution objects affecting the visual pollution index and revenue generation potential of a place. Current practices of uninformed and uncontrolled outdoor advertising (especially billboards) impairs effective control of visual pollution in developing countries. Improving this can result in over 20% reduction of visual pollution. This article presents a spatial decision support system (SDSS) to facilitate all the stakeholders (development control authorities, advertisers, billboard owners, and the public) in balancing the optimal positioning of billboards under the governing regulations. In terms of its technical implementation, SDSS is based on well-known geospatial open source technologies and uses an analytical hierarchy process AHP-inspired approach in spatial decision-making. It can help users through its category-specific user interface to identify potential sites to position new billboards and the selection of boards from existing sites based on a wide variety of characteristics. The observations of all stakeholders have been recorded through panel feedback to assess the system's initial effectiveness. The proposed system has been found functional in identifying hot spots for the focused management and exploration of the best suitable sites for new billboards. So, it helps the advertising agencies, urban authorities, and city councils in better planning and management of existing billboard locations to optimize revenue and improve urban aesthetics. The system can be replicated in other countries irrespective of spatial boundaries by incorporating jurisdictional rules and regulations.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

Concentration data for each month of the first semester of 2020 were compared with those of the previous six years, on monthly, daily, and hourly bases, so that pre, during, and post-lockdown conditions of air quality could be separately analyzed. The results show that, as in many other areas worldwide, the Po Valley experienced better air quality during 2020 spring months for NO2 and benzene. In agreement with the reductions of nitrogen oxides and benzene emissions from road traffic, estimated to be -35% compared to the regional average, the monthly mean concentration levels for 2020 showed reductions in the -40% to -35% range compared with the previous years, but with higher reductions, close to -50%, at high-volume-traffic sites in urban areas. Conversely, NH3 ambient concentration levels, almost entirely due the emissions of the agricultural sector, did not show any relevant change, even at high-volume-traffic sites in urban areas. These results point out the important role of traffic emissions in NO2 and benzene ambient levels in the Po Valley, and confirm that this region is a rather homogeneous air basin with urban area hot-spots, the contributions of which add up to a relatively high regional background concentration level. Additionally, the relatively slow response of the air quality levels to the sudden decrease of the emissions due to the lockdown shows that this region is characterized by a weak exchange of the air masses that favors both the build-up of atmospheric pollutants and the development of secondary formation processes. Thus, air quality control strategies should aim for structural interventions intended to reduce traffic emissions at the regional scale and not only in the largest urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,Italy,,

The work was driven by Landsat 8 land surface temperature (LST) data related to 2015-2019 summer daytime periods. Hot-spot analysis was performed adopting Getis-Ord Gi* spatial statistics applied on mean summer LST datasets to obtain location and boundaries of hot- and cool-spot areas. Each hot- and cool-spot was classified by using three significance threshold levels: 90% (LEVEL-1), 95% (LEVEL-2), and 99% (LEVEL-3). A set of open data urban elements directly or indirectly related to LST at local scale were calculated for each hot- and cool-spot area: (1) Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), (2) tree cover (TC), (3) water bodies (WB), (4) impervious areas (IA), (5) mean spatial albedo (ALB), (6) surface areas (SA), (7) Shape index (SI), (8) Sky View Factor (SVF), (9) theoretical solar radiation (RJ), and (10) mean population density (PD). A General Dominance Analysis (GDA) framework was adopted to investigate the relative importance of urban factors affecting thermal hot- and cool-spot areas. The results showed that 11.5% of the studied area is affected by cool-spots and 6.5% by hot-spots. The average LST variation between hot- and cold-spot areas was about 10 degrees C and it was 15 degrees C among the extreme hot- and cool-spot levels (LEVEL-3). Hot-spot detection was magnified by the role of vegetation (NDVI and TC) combined with the significant contribution of other urban elements. In particular, TC, NDVI and ALB were identified as the most significant predictors (p-values < 0.001) of the most extreme cool-spot level (LEVEL-3). NDVI, PD, ALB, and SVF were selected as the most significant predictors (p-values < 0.05 for PD and SVF; p-values < 0.001 for NDVI and ALB) of the hot-spot LEVEL-3.

Few studies, however, have investigated the spatial variation of air temperature within a city. Using air temperature data collected from 117 weather stations in Shenzhen for the year of 2017, we quantified the within-city spatial pattern of air temperature and its nocturnal and seasonal variability. We further investigated the quantitative relationship between air temperature and LST and compared their spatiotemporal patterns. We found that: 1) Air temperature varied greatly in space, showing very strong spatial heterogeneity and having large nocturnal and seasonal variability; 2) The spatial and temporal variation is more prominent during extreme heat days, during which the difference of hourly maximum temperature among stations could reach 8.7 degrees C around 16:00 and remain as high as 8.6 degrees C until 23:00, indicating that locations in cities with higher temperatures may suffer more intensive and longer excessive urban heat, and thereby global warming may exacerbate the difference in air temperature at the local scale; 3) LST had significantly positive correlations with air temperature, especially in the summer night, but their cool and hot spots did not always overlap in space. Results can enhance understanding of the spatial heterogeneity of the urban thermal environment and have practical implications on excessive urban heat mitigation and adaptation in an increasingly warming global climate.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,URBAN HEAT-ISLAND;LOCAL CLIMATE ZONES;RURAL-AREAS;IMPACT;VARIABILITY;PATTERN;CITIES;COVER;INTENSITY;MORTALITY,,

By modelling residential-choice behaviour in the city of Leipzig, Germany, we seek to examine how exposure and vulnerabilities are shaped by the residential-location-choice process. The proposed approach reveals hot spots and cold spots of residential choice for distinct socioeconomic groups exhibiting heterogeneous preferences. We discuss the relationship between observed patterns and disaster risk through the lens of exposure and vulnerability, as well as links to urban planning, and explore how the proposed methodology may contribute to predicting future trends in exposure, vulnerability, and risk through this analytical focus.

Daytime temperature and humidity values of 14 urban locations were collected to determine HI to recognize thermal urban hotspots in Colombo area. A pretested comprehensive random-stratified questionnaire survey has been conducted to appraise the thermal discernment of the general public. ENVImet microclimate model was accompanied to test the temperature reduction levels in different bioclimatic green infrastructure scenarios [Two belts (R-1), three belts (R-2), four belts (R-3), five belts (R-4)] in the selected study site. Five sites (Borella, Colombo Fort, Maradana, Wellawaththa, Liberty junction) were identified as thermal hotspots in Colombo metropolitan. HI values were fluctuated within 33.82-40.35 degrees C range and the highest average day time HI value was observed at Maradana (40.35 degrees C) and the lowest HI was observed at Thummulla (33.82 degrees C).

We find that time in biodiverse riparian areas and areas of perceived aesthetic value correlates with decreases in salivary cortisol and improved well-being for hikers. Wildlife sightings were not associated with changes in salivary cortisol, but were associated with riparian travel and aesthetic preferences, indicating an indirect pathway for ecosystem services. Additionally, wildlife sightings decreased on high-use days, even though hikers did not perceive a negative impact of their recreational activity.

The study also aims at modelling the average body mass index (BMI) values using the spatial regression and the performance compared with the standard regression model. Design This is a cross-sectional study using data from the 2014 Ghana Demographic and Health Survey (GDHS). Setting The study was set in Ghana. Participants and methods Data on 4393 non-pregnant women aged 15-49 years from the 2014 GDHS. Both global (Moran's I) and the local indicators for spatial dependence were examined through the mapped BMI values across the country by clusters. An estimated spatial lag model was used to explain the spatial differences in the average body sizes of women. Results The overall prevalence of overweight/obesity among reproductive women in Ghana was 35.4%, and this was highly prevalent among educated women (p<0.001), those from wealthy households (p<0.001) and dwelling in an urban setting (p<0.001). Significant clustering (Moran's I=0.3145, p<0.01) of overweight/obesity was observed with hot spots (clustering) in Greater Accra, Central, Western and Ashanti regions. The spatial lag model was the best fit based on the Likelihood ratio test and the Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values. The mean age of women and household wealth were significant factors accounting for the increase in the average cluster body size (BMI) of women and the spatial differences. Conclusion The prevalence of overweight/obesity was high and spatially clustered in the southern, middle and coastal regions. Geographic specific and effective public health interventions and strategies are needed to address the growing morbidity burden associated with the rise in the average body sizes of reproductive women.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,GLOBAL BURDEN;ASSOCIATION;MARRIAGE;Prevalence;Ghana,,

Corridors with these characteristics clearly have the potential to produce high numbers of pedestrian fatalities. We also used hierarchical clustering to classify the hot spots based on their roadway and surrounding landuse characteristics into three types: regional highways, urban primary arterial roadways, and New York City thoroughfares.

Here, using a broad screening approach, we characterize the composition and distribution of EOCs in groundwater in the Gangetic Plain around Patna (Bihar), as an exemplar of a rapidly developing urban area in northern India. A total of 73 EOCs were detected in 51 samples, typically at ng.L-1 to low mu g.L-1 concentrations, relating to medical and veterinary, agrochemical, industrial and lifestyle usage. Concentrations were often dominated by the lifestyle chemical and artificial sweetener sucralose. Seventeen identified EOCs are flagged as priority compounds by the European Commission, World Health Organisation and/or World Organisation for Animal Health: namely, herbicides diuron and atrazine; insecticides imidacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin and acetamiprid; the surfactant perfluorooctane sulfonate (and related perfluorobutane sulfonate, perfluorohexane sulfonate, perfluorooctanoic acid and perfluoropentane sulfonate); and medical/veterinary compounds sulfamethoxazole, sulfanilamide, dapson, sulfathiazole, sulfamethazine and diclofenac. The spatial distribution of EOCs varies widely, with concentrations declining with depth, consistent with a strong dominant vertical flow control. Groundwater EOC concentrations in Patna were found to peak within similar to 10 km distance from the River Ganges, indicating mainly urban inputs with some local pollution hot-spots. A heterogeneous relationship between EOCs and population density likely reflects confounding factors including varying input types and controls (e.g. spatial, temporal), wastewater treatment infrastructure and groundwater abstraction. Strong seasonal agreement in EOC concentrations was observed. Co-existence of limited transformation products with associated parent compounds indicate active microbial degradation processes. This study characterizes key controls on the distribution of groundwater EOCs across the urban to rural transition near Patna, as a rapidly developing Indian city, and contributes to the wider understanding of the vulnerability of shallow groundwater to surface-derived contamination in similar environments.

This study characterizes vaccine hesitancy in Shanghai and identifies disparities in vaccine safety and efficacy concerns by residency status-a marker for recent migration into the city.        Methods: Parents of children aged <= 18 years from immunization clinics in Shanghai were enrolled in summer 2019, with the data analyzed during winter 2019-2020. The paper questionnaire used the Parental Attitudes towards Childhood Vaccines scale, which included questions about vaccine safety and efficacy concerns. The primary independent variable was residency-whether an individual was a Shanghai local or a recent migrant (i.e., non-local). Linear regression models assessed the relationship between residency and vaccine safety and efficacy concerns.        Results: Among 1,021 participants, 65.4% had local residency, and the remainder were urban non-locals (13.1%) or rural non-locals (21.5%). A majority of parents expressed concerns about vaccine side effects (73.8%), vaccine safety (63.9%), and vaccine effectiveness (52.4%).

One computationally efficient way is to treat neighbourhoods as patches of porous media to which the flow adjusts. Here we use conceptual arguments and large-eddy simulation to formulate two flow regimes based on the size of patches of different frontal-area density within neighbourhoods. One of these flow regimes distributes pollutants in counter-intuitive ways, such as producing pollution 'hot spots' in patches of lower frontal-area density. The regimes provide the first quantitative definition of the 'urban background', which can be used for more precisely targeted pollution monitoring. They also provide a conceptual basis for further research into neighbourhood-scale air-pollution problems, such as parametrizations in mesoscale models, and the transport of fluid constituents in other porous media.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LARGE-EDDY SIMULATION;TURBULENT-BOUNDARY-LAYER;3-D BUILDING ARRAY;URBAN HEAT-ISLAND;AIR-FLOW;CFD SIMULATION;ROUGHNESS SUBLAYER;PLUME        DISPERSION;STREET CANYONS;FOREST-EDGE,,

During these times, effluent from wastewater treatment plants can make up the majority of flow in the river. However, water quality in urban systems can also be strongly influenced by the natural or human-influenced flow regime and discharge from other anthropogenic sources such as industrial operations and runoff from impervious surfaces. In this study, we aimed to determine whether water quality was controlled primarily by wastewater discharge in an effluent-dominated river. Between May 2016-May 2019, we systematically measured water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, biochemical oxygen demand, and the concentrations of nitrate-N, ammonia-N, and orthophosphate in the South Platte River in the Denver metropolitan area, Colorado, USA. We found that, despite being an effluent-dominated river, wastewater treatment plant discharge was not the principal factor controlling water quality in many of the sampled areas. Non-point source pollution from impervious surfaces, delivered to the river through storm drains and minor tributary streams, also contributed to the high nutrient conditions in several locations. We also noted a strong seasonality in water quality, with higher concentrations of nutrients and higher biochemical oxygen demand in the winter months when wastewater effluent can make up more than 90% of the flow in the river. Thus, the interaction of discharge location and reduced seasonal flow produced spatio-temporal hot spots of diminished water quality. More stringent enforcement of water quality regulations may improve water quality in this system. However, a large portion of the pollution seems to be from non-point sources, which are very difficult to control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,AQUATIC SYSTEMS;STREAMS;ECOSYSTEMS;POLLUTION;MOMENTS;URBANIZATION;HYDROLOGY;NUTRIENTS;NITROGEN;IMPACTS,,

Understanding the relationship between human activities and functional areas is key to identifying the real-time urban functional areas based on trajectories. Few previous studies have analyzed the interactive information on humans and regions for functional area identification. The relationship between human activities and residential areas is the most representative for urban functional areas because residential areas cover a wide range and are closely connected with human life. The aim of this paper is to propose the CARA (Commuting Activity and Residential Area) model to quantify the correlation between human activities and urban residential areas. In this model, human activities are represented by hot spots extracted by the Gaussian Mixture Model algorithm while residential areas are represented by POI (point of interest) data. The model shows that human activities and residential areas present a logarithmic relationship. The CARA model is further assessed by retrieving urban residential areas in Tengzhou City from shared e-bike trajectories. Compared with the actual map, the accuracy reaches 83.3%, thus demonstrating the model's reliability and feasibility.

Traditionally, police crash reports (PCR) have been used as the primary source of crash data in safety studies. However, using PCR as the sole source of information has several drawbacks. For example, some crashes, which do not cause extensive property damage, are mostly underreported. Underreporting of crashes can significantly influence the effectiveness of data-driven safety analysis and prevent safety analysts from reaching statistically meaningful results. Crowdsourced traffic incident data such as Waze have great potential to complement traditional safety analysis by providing user-captured crash and traffic incident data. However, using these data sources also has some challenges. One of the major problems is data redundancy because many people may report the same event. In this paper, the authors explore the potential of using crowdsourced Waze incident reports (WIRs) to identify high-risk road segments. The researchers first propose a new methodology to eliminate redundant WIRs. Then, the researchers use WIRs and PCRs from an I-35 corridor in North Texas to conduct the safety analysis. Results demonstrated that WIRs and PCRs are spatially correlated; however, their temporal distributions are significantly different. WIRs have broader coverage, with 60.24 percent of road segments in the study site receiving more WIRs than PCRs. Moreover, by combining WIRs with PCRs, more high-risk road segments can be identified (14 miles) than the results generated from PCRs (8 miles).","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,"",,

However, the aerosol effects are unaccounted for in most operational hurricane forecast models. We combined multisource measurements and cloud-resolving model simulations to show fundamentally altered cloud microphysical and thermodynamic processes by anthropogenic aerosols during Hurricane Harvey. Our observational analyses reveal intense lightning and precipitation in the proximity of Houston industrial areas, and these hot spots exhibit a striking geographic similarity to a climatological maximum of lightning flash density in the south-central United States. Our ensemble cloud-resolving simulations of Hurricane Harvey indicate that aerosols increase precipitation and lightning by a factor of 2 in the Houston urban area, unraveling the key anthropogenic factor in regulating flooding during this weather extreme.        Plain Language Summary The catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Harvey has received major attention, but the cause remains mysterious. The destructive power of tropical cyclones is produced by the latent heat release from phase change of water, which is linked to airborne particles emitted from vehicles and petrochemical plants. By combining observation and model simulations, our work provides microphysical and thermodynamic insights into the cause of the catastrophic flooding during Hurricane Harvey by the aerosols from industrial sources.

Both crime and harm concentration are consistently less spatially clustered than expected by the theory in a post-socialist city. This finding has significance for both international criminology and national policing authorities, because the success of place-based policing is highly dependent on strong spatial clustering of crime. The study underlines the importance of experimental criminology and theory testing for the transfer of crime prevention approaches from their original contexts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,ROUTINE ACTIVITIES;VIOLENT CRIME;URBAN-CRIME;HOT-SPOTS;CRIMINOLOGY;PATTERNS;POLICE;DISORGANIZATION;TRAJECTORIES;TRANSITION;Crime,,

This study aimed to examine to what degree the occurrences of violent crimes can be affected by social and built environment over space. Although a few studies have attempted to model crime rate using spatial regression models, there is a lack of comparison of spatial regression models. Particularly, the eigenvector spatial filtering type of spatial regression models has reportedly been effective in urban and regional studies, but it has not been widely applied to crime data. In this study, we aimed to examine whether the spatial filtering type of spatial regression models outperforms conventional types of spatial regression models in modeling violent crime rates over space. Moreover, we aimed to investigate the impacts of land use mix and street connectivity on the occurrences of violent crimes as the routine activity theory explained. In empirical studies, two types of spatial regression models (i.e., spatial error model and eigenvector spatial filtering model) were selected and estimated successfully to model local-scale violent crime rates across New York City. The eigenvector spatial filtering models outperform the spatial error models as well as the nonspatial models. Model estimation results show that occurrences of violent crimes (i.e., assaults and robberies) can be well determined by socioeconomic and built environment factors and thereby environmental factors can affect the occurrences of violent crimes. The contributions of socioeconomic and built environment factors to violent crime can offer insights on urban planning and policymaking toward violent crime prevention. Particularly, this study offers new evidence on the routine activity theory that increasing land use mix and street connectivity can enhance street activity, thereby reducing occurrences of violent crimes. Policymakers and urban planners should continue to enhance street activity through increasing land use mix and street connectivity. In addition, eigenvector spatial filtering models are advocated for use in crime or other applications in urban and regional studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,HOT-SPOTS;DYNAMICS;Crime,,

Many large cities have built monitoring stations to continuously measure different air pollutants. While most stations follow defined rules in terms of measurement height and distance to traffic emissions, the question remains of how representative are those point measurements for the city-wide air quality. The question of the spatial coverage of a point measurement is important because it defines the area of influence and coverage of monitoring networks, determines how to assimilate monitoring data into model simulations or compare to satellite data with a coarser resolution, and is essential to assess the impact of the acquired data on public health.        In order to answer this question, we combined different measurement data sets consisting of path-averaging remote sensing data and in situ point measurements in stationary and mobile setups from a measurement campaign that took place in Munich, Germany, in June and July 2016. We developed an algorithm to strip temporal from spatial patterns in order to construct a consistent NO2 pollution map for Munich. Continuous long-path differential optical absorption spectroscopy (LP DOAS) measurements were complemented with mobile cavity-enhanced (CE) DOAS, chemiluminescence (CL) and cavity attenuated phase shift (CAPS) instruments and were compared to monitoring stations and satellite data. In order to generate a consistent composite map, the LP DOAS diurnal cycle has been used to normalize for the time of the day dependency of the source patterns, so that spatial and temporal patterns can be analyzed separately. The resulting concentration map visualizes pollution hot spots at traffic junctions and tunnel exits in Munich, providing insights into the strong spatial variations. On the other hand, this database is beneficial to the urban planning and the design of control measures of environment pollution. Directly comparing on-street mobile measurements in the vicinity of monitoring stations resulted in a difference of 48 %. For the extrapolation of the monitoring station data to street level, we determined the influence of the measuring height and distance to the street. We found that a measuring height of 4 m, at which the Munich monitoring stations measure, results in 16 % lower average concentrations than a measuring height of 1.5 m, which is the height of the inlet of our mobile measurements and a typical pedestrian breathing height. The horizontal distance of most stations to the center of the street of about 6 m also results in an average reduction of 13 % compared to street level concentration. A difference of 21 % in the NO2 concentrations remained, which could be an indication that city-wide measurements are needed for capturing the full range and variability of concentrations for assessing pollutant exposure and air quality in cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ON-ROAD MEASUREMENT;ENHANCED ABSORPTION SPECTROMETER;RING-DOWN        SPECTROSCOPY;CAVITY RING;AIR-POLLUTION;PARTICULATE MATTER;SECONDARY        AEROSOL;EXHAUST PLUME;CE-DOAS;NO2;Nitrogen Dioxide;Nitrogen,,

Trihalomethanes (THMs) are one of themajor classes of regulated disinfection byproducts, formed when a specific fraction of the organic carbon pool-referred to as THM precursors-reacts with chorine and/or bromine during treatment. Understanding the source, fate, timing and duration of the organic compounds that react to form THMs will allow identification of targeted and effective management actions. In this study we evaluated THM precursor contributions from multiple land use categories and hydrologic contexts, including novel data for urban land uses that demonstrate strong potential to release water with high THM formation potential (THMFP; median 618 mu g L-1): greater than storm runoff integrated across a mixed-use (1/3 natural, 2/3 agricultural) watershed (median 460 mu g L-1), irrigation runoff from agricultural systems (357 mu g L-1), or runoff from a natural forested (median 123 mu g L-1) and shrubland/grassland (median 259 mu g L-1) watersheds. While individual storm events released high THM precursor concentrations over short periods, dry season agricultural irrigation as well as urban landscapes have the potential to release water high in THM precursors for several months. Experimental bioassays and sampling along 333miles of the California Aqueduct confirmed bioavailability and photooxidation potential of less than 10% for THM precursors, suggesting that rivers with residence times of days to weeks may act as THM precursor conduits, shuttling THM precursors from hundreds of miles away to drinking water in takes with minimal degradation. This finding has considerable implications for water managers, who may therefore consider THM precursor management strategies that target even sources located far upstream.

The hierarchical and spatial subnetwork structure of national population movement networks is analysed by using Baidu migration data before and during the Chinese Spring Festival. The results show that the population flow was mainly concentrated on the east side of the Hu Huanyong Line, a national east-west division of population density. Some local hot spots of migration were formed in various regions. Although there were a large number of migrants in eastern regions, they tended to concentrate in corresponding provincial capital cities and the population movement subnetworks were affected by provincial administrative divisions. The patterns identified are helpful for the provincial government to formulate population policies on epidemic control. The movement flow from Wuhan (the city where the covid-19 outbreak) to other cities is significantly and positively correlated with the number of confirmed cases in other Chinese cities (about 70% of the population was constituted through innerprovincial movement in Hubei). The results show that the population flow network has great significance for informing the containment of the epidemic spread in the early stage. It suggests the importance for the Chinese government to implement provincial and municipal lockdown measures to contain the epidemic spread.

Cities were hot-spots for human emissions, while districts with high livestock populations accounted for the highest animal emissions. Our model was the most sensitive to oocyst excretion rates. The results indicated that 74% and 87% of total emissions came from urban areas and humans, respectively, and 86% of total human emissions were produced by the urban population. The scenario analysis showed a potential decrease in oocyst and cyst emissions with improvements in urbanization, sanitation, wastewater treatment, and manure management, regardless of population increase.

Besides, over the past decades, important land cover changes have occurred, such as reforestation, agricultural intensification, urban expansion and the construction of many reservoirs. Here we study the impacts of these changes in a typical large Mediterranean catchment and focus on relevant ecosystem services, i.e. primary production, water supply, food production, water regulation, flood and erosion control, and cultural ecosystem services. We applied a hydrological model, coupled with a soil erosion and sediment transport model, for the period 1971-2010 to the entire catchment, and for an extended period (1952-2018), with more pronounced land use changes, to one of its subcatchments that plays a crucial role for regional drinking water provision. Climate change in the evaluated period is characterized by a decrease in precipitation and an increase in temperature. Land use changes included an increase in natural vegetation in the headwaters, agricultural intensification and reservoir construction in the central part, and urban expansion in the downstream part of the catchment. The positive impacts on ecosystem services were quantified by a decrease in hillslope erosion, sediment yield, sediment concentration and flood discharge, which are mainly attributed to climate change and reservoir construction. The negative impacts were quantified by an increase in plant water stress and a decrease in reservoir storage, for which the latter is mainly attributed to reforestation in the headwater catchments. While grey infrastructures like reservoir construction showed important positive impacts on some ecosystem services, such as water regulation and flood control, they also potentially induce negative impacts, such as an increase of water demand and ecological integrity. We argue that a shift is needed to green infrastructures and nature-based solutions, such as reforestation and sustainable land management, which may lead to similar benefits on ecosystem services, but without the negative impacts caused by grey infrastructures. This supports the need for integrated land-use management to sustainably protect ecosystem services, considering the expected climate change impacts on Mediterranean environments and societies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,DAILY PRECIPITATION CONCENTRATION;SEGURA RIVER-BASIN;WATER-RESOURCES;SOIL-EROSION;CONSERVATION AGRICULTURE;EXTREME PRECIPITATION;SEDIMENT        TRANSPORT;CHECK-DAMS;ABANDONMENT;MANAGEMENT,,

The unmanageable and mushroom growth of industries and an exponential soar in population has made the ascent of air pollution intractable. To this end, the solutions that are based on the latest technologies, such as the Internet of things (IoT) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) are becoming increasingly popular and they have capabilities to monitor the extent and scale of air contaminants and would be subsequently useful for containing them. With centralized cloud-based IoT platforms, the ubiquitous and continuous monitoring of air quality and data processing can be facilitated for the identification of air pollution hot spots. However, owing to the inherent characteristics of cloud, such as large end-to-end delay and bandwidth constraint, handling the high velocity and large volume of data that are generated by distributed IoT sensors would not be feasible in the longer run. To address these issues, fog computing is a powerful paradigm, where the data are processed and filtered near the end of the IoT nodes and it is useful for improving the quality of service (QoS) of IoT network. To further improve the QoS, a conceptual model of distributed fog computing and a machine learning based data processing and analysis model is proposed for the optimal utilization of cloud resources. The proposed model provides a classification accuracy of 99% while using a Support Vector Machines (SVM) classifier. This model is also simulated in iFogSim toolkit. It affords many advantages, such as reduced load on the central server by locally processing the data and reporting the quality of air. Additionally, it would offer the scalability of the system by integrating more air quality monitoring nodes in the IoT network.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,EDGE;SIMULATION;SCENARIOS;CLOUD;Internet,,

We compile microplastics emission data for the Baltic Sea region, calculate emissions for each pathway and develop emission scenarios for selected polymer types, namely polyethylene (PE)/polypropylene (PP) and the polyester polyethylene terephthalate (PET). PE/PP and PET differ with respect to their density and can be regarded as representative for large groups of polymers. We consider particles between 20-500 mu m with varying shapes. The emission scenarios serve as input for 3D-model simulations, which allow us to estimate transport, behavior, and deposition in the Baltic Sea environment. According to our model results, the average residence time of PET and PE/PP in the Baltic Sea water body is about 14 days. Microplastics from urban sources cause average concentrations of 1.4 PE/PP (0.7 PET) particles/m(2) sea surface (20-500 mu m size range) in the Baltic Sea during summer. Average concentrations of PET, resulting from urban sources, at the sea floor are 4 particles/m(2) sediment surface during summer. Our model approach suggests that accumulation at the shoreline is the major sink for microplastic with annual coastal PE/PP and PET accumulation rates of up to 10(8) particles/m each near emission hot-spots and in enclosed and semi-closed systems. All concentrations show strong spatial and temporal variability and are linked to high uncertainties. The seasonality of CSS (including stormwater) emissions is assessed in detail. In the south-eastern Baltic, emissions during July and August can be up to 50% of the annual CSS and above 1/3 of the total annual microplastic emissions. The practical consequences especially for monitoring, which should focus on beaches, are discussed. Further, it seems that PET, PE/PP can serve as indicators to assess the state of pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,WATER TREATMENT PLANTS;PLASTIC DEBRIS;ABUNDANCE;SEDIMENTS;FATE;RETENTION;PARTICLES;BAY;ARCHIPELAGO;ESTUARIES,,

The virus circulates in enzootic cycles between multiple species of mosquitoes, wildlife reservoir hosts and humans. Public health concern about RRV is increasing due to rising incidence rates in Australian urban centres, along with increased circulation in Pacific Island countries. Australia experienced its largest recorded outbreak of 9544 cases in 2015, with the majority reported from south east Queensland (SEQ). This study examined potential links between disease patterns and transmission pathways of RRV.MethodsThe spatial and temporal distribution of notified RRV cases, and associated epidemiological features in SEQ, were analysed for the period 2001-2016. This included fine-scale analysis of disease patterns across the suburbs of the capital city of Brisbane, and those of 8 adjacent Local Government Areas, and host spot analyses to identify locations with significantly high incidence.ResultsThe mean annual incidence rate for the region was 41/100,000 with a consistent seasonal peak in cases between February and May. The highest RRV incidence was in adults aged from 30 to 64years (mean incidence rate: 59/100,000), and females had higher incidence rates than males (mean incidence rates: 44/100,000 and 34/100,000, respectively). Spatial patterns of disease were heterogeneous between years, and there was a wide distribution of disease across both urban and rural areas of SEQ. Overall, the highest incidence rates were reported from predominantly rural suburbs to the north of Brisbane City, with significant hot spots located in peri-urban suburbs where residential, agricultural and conserved natural land use types intersect.ConclusionsAlthough RRV is endemic across all of SEQ, transmission is most concentrated in areas where urban and peri-urban environments intersect. The drivers of RRV transmission across rural-urban landscapes should be prioritised for further investigation, including identification of specific vectors and hosts that mediate human spillover.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,MOSQUITO SPECIES DIPTERA;LAND-USE;EPIDEMIC POLYARTHRITIS;ENVIRONMENTAL-FACTORS;ARBOVIRUS INFECTIONS;CLIMATE VARIABILITY;BORNE        DISEASE;MURRAY VALLEY;TRANSMISSION;BRISBANE;Queensland;Australia,,

However, how the spatially explicit factors interact to influence household decision choices at the local level is not well understood. This paper's objective is to identify, map, and analyze spatial dependency and heterogeneity in factors that impede poor smallholders from participating in agribusiness markets. Using the researcher-administered survey questionnaires, we collected geo-referenced data from 392 households in Western Kenya. We used three spatial geostatistics methods in Geographic Information System to analyze data-Global Moran's I, Cluster and Outliers Analysis, and geographically weighted regression. Results show that factors impeding smallholder farmers exhibited local spatial autocorrelation that was linked to the local context. We identified distinct local spatial clusters (hot spots and cold spots clusters) that were spatially and statistically significant. Results affirm that spatially explicit factors play a crucial role in influencing the farming decisions of smallholder households. The paper has demonstrated that geospatial analysis using geographically disaggregated data and methods could help in the identification of resource-poor households and neighborhoods. To improve poor smallholders' participation in agribusiness, we recommend policymakers to design spatially targeted interventions that are embedded in the local context and informed by locally expressed needs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,FOOD SECURITY;AUTOCORRELATION;ASSOCIATION;MARKETS;GROWTH;Kenya;Health Resources,,

A single question was posted through a web App, to which the anonymous participants subjectively answered whether or not they had experienced any COVID-19 disease symptoms. Our main goal was to locate geographical areas with increased number of people feeling the symptoms and to determine any temporal changes in the statistics of the survey entries. It was found that the application was rapidly disseminated to the entire Greek territory via social media, having, thus, a great public reception. The higher percentages of participants experiencing symptoms coincided geographically with the highly populated urban areas, having also increased numbers of confirmed cases, while temporal variations were detected that accorded with the restrictions of activities. This application demonstrates that health systems can use crowdsourcing applications that assure anonymity, as an alternative to tracing apps, to identify possible hot spots and to reach and warn the public within a short time interval, increasing at the same time their situational awareness.

Previous studies had explored the effect of land-use type on waterlogging in relatively small watersheds. Few, however, have comprehensively revealed the relative contributions of the environmental and anthropogenic factors to urban waterlogging concerning different scales of analysis. Indeed what is less known, are the dominant factors and the appropriate scale of analysis. To overcome this limitation, a novel method that integrates the stepwise regression model with hierarchical partitioning analysis is presented. The purpose is to investigate the complex mechanism of urban waterlogging by identifying the relative contribution of each environmental and anthropogenic factor and the stability linking waterlogging to influencing factors at multiple scales of analysis (i.e. 1 km, 2 km, 3 km, 4 km, and 5 km). We consider waterlogging events in the central urban districts of Guangzhou (PR China) from 2009 to 2015 as a case study. The results show that the spatial distribution of waterlogging events in the central urban area presents a strong agglomeration pattern. The waterlogging hot spots are mainly concentrated in the historical area of Guangzhou. Under all analysis scales, we find that the percent cover of urban green spaces (44.74%), percent cover of residential area (41.03%), and slope.std (36.85%) both have a dominant contribution to urban waterlogging, which suggests the importance of land cover composition in determining urban waterlogging. However, the relative contribution and dominant factors of waterlogging varied across different analysis scales, presenting a strong scale effect. Under a small analysis scale (1 km), the topography factors (slope.std and relative elevation) are confirmed as the dominant variables; however, with the increase of analysis scale, the influence of land cover composition (greenspace, residence area, grassland) and land cover spatial configuration (LPI, AI, Cohesion index) on waterlogging magnitude is greater than other factors. This finding provides additional insights that the urban waterlogging can be alleviated by balancing the relative composition of land cover features as well as by optimizing their spatial configuration. Since the optimal statistical scale for urban waterlogging studies only worked for specific influencing factors, the appropriate analysis scale for urban waterlogging study should be determined by the characteristics of study areas. This study has the capability to extend our scientific understanding of the complex mechanisms of waterlogging in the highly urbanized coastal city, providing useful support for the prevention and management of urban waterlogging.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-USE;FLOOD SUSCEPTIBILITY;RISK-ASSESSMENT;CLIMATE-CHANGE;IMPACTS;CITY;URBANIZATION;VULNERABILITY;PREDICTION;DRAINAGE;China,,

The present study examines how illegal firearm availability (IFA) is related to firearm violence at the neighborhood level. We analyzed 3 years (from 2005 to 2007) of recovered firearm and violent index crime data from Newark, New Jersey. Violent index crime is separated into three categories by level of firearm use: shootings, display of firearm violence (DFV), and no-firearm violence (NFV). Negative binominal regression was conducted to examine the relationship between IFA and firearm violence at the neighborhood level while controlling for neighborhood conditions. Firearm violence is prevalent in Newark: over 90% of homicides and 47% of robberies were committed with a firearm. IFA is related to increased shootings and NFV, but not to DFV. IFA is a robust predictor of shootings in Newark, New Jersey. Neighborhood conditions influence IFA and firearm violence. IFA may reflect neighborhood distress level, given that areas with high IFA experience increased firearm violence as well as NFV. The local clustering of violent crime suggests placed-focused policing strategies aimed at removing firearms would aid in curbing serious firearm violence in urban neighborhoods.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,GUN OWNERSHIP;CRIME RATES;HOT-SPOTS;HOMICIDE;PATTERNS;VICTIMIZATION;CRIMINOLOGY;IMPACT;STATE;US;Violence,,

Twenty-six acacia and three honey samples with unknown botanical origin were collected between 1958 and 2018 and analysed for elemental composition by Microwave Plasma Atomic Emission Spectrometry (MP-AES). The elemental analysis was coupled with independent dating method by Accelerator Mass Spectrometry (AMS) to confirm the calendar age of the honey samples and test the possibility of radiocarbon based dating of bee products, which has not been applied before.        According to the analytical measurements and statistical analysis, we can conclude that the elemental composition shows change with time in the acacia honey during the last five decades. We have proven that honey preserves carbon isotopic and elemental information of its production time and thus can be applied as an environmental indicator (e.g. trace urban pollutants, precipitation, local industrial or agricultural emission) in reconstruction studies by analysing the non-degradable mineral content. Our results further show that acacia honey is a suitable material for radiocarbon dating, proved by the results compared to the atmospheric radiocarbon bomb-peak. The new approach presented for investigation of honey by radiocarbon-based age determination coupled with elemental analysis can be used in biological, dietary, archaeological or other multidisciplinary studies as well. Some samples show slightly depleted radiocarbon content. This could be an indication of local fossil CO2 emission. Based on these depleted C-14 results, honey could be used for atmospheric monitoring of fossil CO2 urban or industrial hot-spots. (c) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Deflectors changed the near-uniform flow to a rapidly varied flow, as such the depth, velocity, and Froude number (Fr) variations were four, 10, and 14 times more than the without deflector scenario, respectively. Removal of hydrogen sulfide (H2S), the main focus of the study, was significantly high when deflectors were placed in the laboratory urban waterway. Introduction of a sediment bed further improved H2S removal; however, in this case turbidity and color were significantly high too. These observations endorse the fact that attenuation induced by deflectors and assimilation promoted by the sediment bed aids the H2S removal. These facts were further strengthened by the significant strong negative correlations H2S made with DO and pH for all experiments. Further studies are recommended for different deflector orientations and modified sediment beds (e.g., mixture of sediment and gravel), identification of localized water quality hot spots to capture spatial variation of water quality, and impact of increased heterogeneity on flood safety. Practitioner points        Increase in physical heterogeneity (by deflectors) on water quality improvement was studied in a laboratory set up.

According to the data from 48 sites of the National Air Quality Monitoring Network, the range of annual average concentration of BaP ranges from 0.4 ng center dot m(-3) at a rural regional station to 7.7 ng center dot m(-3) at an industrial station. Additionally, short-term campaign measurements in small settlements have recorded high values of daily benzo[a]pyrene concentrations (0.1-13.6 ng center dot m(-3)) in winter months linked to local heating of household heating. The transboundary contribution to the annual average concentrations of BaP was estimated by the CAMx model to range from 46% to 70% over most of the country. However, the contribution of Czech sources can exceed 80% in residential heating hot spots. It is likely that the transboundary contribution to BaP concentrations was overestimated by a factor of 1.5 due to limitations of the modeling approach used. During the period of 2012-2018, 35-58% of the urban population in the Czech Republic were exposed to BaP concentrations above target. A significant decreasing trend, estimated by the Mann-Kendall test, was found for annual and winter BaP concentrations between 2008 and 2018.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;PRENATAL EXPOSURE;PAHS;PARTICLES;EUROPE;JAPAN;PORTO;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Benzo(a)pyrene;7,8-Dihydro-7,8-dihydroxybenzo(a)pyrene 9,10-oxide;Benzopyrene Hydroxylase;Czech Republic",,

A Local Climate Zone map of Tel Aviv was created using Geographic Information System (GIS), and satellite images were used to identify the spatial patterns of the urban heat island (UHI). Climatic variables were measured by fixed meteorological stations and by mobile cross-section. Surface and wall temperatures were obtained by satellite images and a hand-held infrared camera. Meteorological measurements at a height of 2 m showed that during midday the city is similar to 3.6 degrees C warmer than the surrounding rural area. The cooling effect of parks was evident only during the hot hours of the day (9:00-17:00). Land Surface Temperature in the southern part of the city was hotter by similar to 7-9 degrees C compared to the northern part due to lack of urban vegetation. Hot spots were found in compact midrise forms (LCZ 2) that are not ideal from the climatological perspective. Whereas compact low-rise forms (LCZ 3) were less heat vulnerable.

This article develops a Geographic Information Systems-based methodology to evaluate the spatial distribution of rainwater catchment potential to identify the most favorable urban areas for the installation of these infrastructures. Since performance and water saving potential of rainwater harvesting systems greatly depends on population density and roof size, this assessment was performed for each residential plot on a per capita basis, based on cadastral data and a method of demographic disaggregation. Furthermore, to evaluate spatial variation of runoff coefficient per building, a supervised classification was carried out to consider the influence of roof types on the rainwater catchment potential. After calculating rainwater catchment potential per capita for each residential plot, the spatial clustering of high (hot spots) and low values (cold spots) was assessed through the Getis-Ord General G statistic. Results indicate a spatial pattern of high rainwater catchment potential values in low-density urban areas, where rainwater catchment systems are expected to offer a better performance and a shorter amortization period. These results may be useful for the enactment of local legislation that regulates the obligation to install these infrastructures or offers subsidies for their implementation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,POTABLE WATER SAVINGS;ENVIRONMENTAL-ANALYSIS;URBAN;CONSUMPTION;SYSTEMS;DROUGHT;QUALITY;RUNOFF;REGION;LEVEL,,

Combining mechanistic epidemiological models based on temperature-trait relationships with climatological data is a powerful technique for environmental risk assessment. However, a limitation of this approach is that the local microclimates experienced by mosquitoes can differ substantially from macroclimate measurements, particularly in heterogeneous urban environments. To address this scaling mismatch, we modeled spatial variation in microclimate temperatures and the thermal potential for dengue transmission byAedes albopictusacross an urban-to-rural gradient in Athens-Clarke County GA. Microclimate data were collected across gradients of tree cover and impervious surface cover. We developed statistical models to predict daily minimum and maximum microclimate temperatures using coarse-resolution gridded macroclimate data (4000 m) and high-resolution land cover data (30 m). The resulting high-resolution microclimate maps were integrated with temperature-dependent mosquito abundance and vectorial capacity models to generate monthly predictions for the summer and early fall of 2018. The highest vectorial capacities were predicted for patches of trees in urban areas with high cover of impervious surfaces. Vectorial capacity was most sensitive to tree cover during the summer and became more sensitive to impervious surfaces in the early fall. Predictions from the same models using temperature data from a local meteorological station consistently over-predicted vectorial capacity compared to the microclimate-based estimates. This work demonstrates that it is feasible to model variation in mosquito microenvironments across an urban-to-rural gradient using satellite Earth observations. Epidemiological models applied to the microclimate maps revealed localized patterns of temperature suitability for disease transmission that would not be detectable using macroclimate data. Incorporating microclimate data into disease transmission models has the potential to yield more spatially precise and ecologically interpretable metrics of mosquito-borne disease transmission risk in urban landscapes.        Author summary Predicting the effects of temperature on mosquito abundance and arbovirus transmission cycles is essential for mapping hot spots of disease risk and projecting responses to climate change. In urban landscapes, the built environment and natural features create distinctive environments. Buildings and roads generate warmer conditions through the urban heat island effect, while vegetation can have a cooling effect because of shading and evaporative heat loss. We used land cover data to map microclimate temperature in Athens-Clarke County, GA and applied a temperature-dependent vectorial capacity model to predict the effects of microclimate on dengue transmission byAedes albopictus. The highest vectorial capacity was predicted in patches of trees located in the urbanized portion of the study area. These locations had relatively warm nighttime and cool daytime temperature, which kept temperatures close to the optimum for disease transmission. This work demonstrates the feasibility of predicting variation in mosquito microenvironments in urban landscapes using satellite Earth observations. Incorporating microclimate data into disease transmission models has the potential to yield more spatially precise and ecologically interpretable metrics of mosquito-borne disease transmission risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,WEST-NILE-VIRUS;ALBOPICTUS DIPTERA-CULICIDAE;AEDES-ALBOPICTUS;CHIKUNGUNYA OUTBREAK;SURFACE TEMPERATURE;SCALE TRANSITION;BORNE        DISEASE;GLOBAL CHANGE;RISK-FACTORS;HEAT-ISLAND,,

Building smart cities is also a long-term task for China to promote new-type urbanization and healthy urban development. Nowadays, China's new urbanization takes wisdom, intelligence and green ecology as the core theory, and an increasing cities have joined the planning and construction of green ecology, intelligent and intelligent urbanization. Landscape pattern optimization is one of the important ways in achieving regional ecological security. With the rapid development of urbanization, the ecological space has been continuously compressed. How to coordinate the contradiction between regional ecological security and social and economic development has become the main problem facing China's land use. In this study, GLP-ESA-ACO coupling model is used to optimize the allocation of landscape pattern under the goal of ecological security and economic coordination, and Jinzhou-Huludao coastal area is taken as an example for empirical research. Maximizing comprehensive benefits is taken as the objective of optimizing landscape pattern allocation, and GLP is applied to quantitatively constrain landscape types from three aspects of ecological security, ecological service function and social and economic development. Based on the ecological suitability assessment of construction land, considering the change rule of landscape pattern characteristics and the ecological service value of each land type, the appropriate land use distribution map is determined as the spatial constraint of landscape pattern optimization. Using ant colony optimization algorithm, under the constraints of quantity and space, and under the guidance of ecological protection, the optimization sequence is determined, and the optimal allocation results of various landscape types are obtained and superimposed to obtain the final optimal allocation map of landscape pattern in Jinzhou-Huludao coastal area. The results show that: (1) The optimal plan meets the land use indicators of actual planning, takes the maximization of comprehensive benefits as the goal, strictly controls the development and construction of ecological sensitive areas along the coastline, and is superior to the urban planning of destroying the ecological coastal zone tidal flat wetland through reclamation; (2) In the optimal plan, the grassland in the northwest mountain area of Jinhu coastal area is converted into forest, which is consistent with the actual situation in the coastal area of Jinzhou-Huludao in 2020, and the hot spots of inland urban construction in the optimal plan are basically consistent with the actual situation. The research method is scientific and reasonable, which can coordinate the contradiction between regional ecological security and social and economic development, provide theoretical basis for land use planning and rational allocation of land resources, and also provide reference for similar research in other regions.

In many cities, there is scope for further improvement in air quality through targeted urban policy interventions. The objective of this protocol is to detail the methods that will be used for a systematic evidence map (SEM) which will identify and characterize the evidence on policy interventions that can be implemented at the urban-level to reduce traffic emissions and/or TRAP from on-road mobile sources, thus reducing human exposures and adverse health impacts.

Studying population aging from a spatial perspective is of vital practical significance. Based on China's census data from 1990 to 2010, this study establishes the indicator system of aging level and chooses the entropy method, standard deviational ellipse, and spatial autocorrelation as main methods. Taking Liaoning province of China as an example, the study measures the aging level of its 100 districts and counties, analyzing the overall spatial movement degree, and elucidates the temporal-spatial evolution of aging development. It further discusses the spatial correlational characteristics between each county unit. The results reveal that, first, the spatial distribution of aging in Liaoning shows an unceasingly intensifying northeast-southwest pattern. County areas along the Shenyang-Dalian line show a stronger effect of aging of the whole province. Second, the average score of aging in all county areas is on the increase; the degree of aging shows an increasing trend, but the speed of aging tends to slow down. Population aging in Liaoning shows an obvious spatial heterogeneity, which is mainly manifested by regional differences, urban-rural differences, and minority differences. Third, Moran's I index of aging level first increases and then decreases; the values are all positive. The overall spatial pattern has a positive correlation; the spatial agglomeration effect is first enhanced and then weakened. The hot spots are distributed in the surrounding counties of Shenyang and Dalian, showing a distribution pattern of two cores; the cold spots gradually form a binary structure represented by Chaoyang-Huludao and Yingkou-Panjin. The study showed the positive spatial correlation of the aging level between the county units, thereby paving the way for future research on the balanced distribution.

The changes in the Nr flow structure in Chongqing, which are mainly attributed to agricultural and industrial production processes, characterized its heavy reliance on primary and secondary industries. This indicates that local resource endowments control internal Nr metabolism and consequently lead to high exports of fertilizer and food commodities. Sankey diagrams show the continuous reduction of local Nr production capacity complemented by increased food and energy imports to meet growing Nr consumption in Beijing and Shanghai. In all cities, economic development is the most dominant factor contributing to the growth of Nr inputs, with partial offsets from the improvements in Nr production intensity effect. Different cities and industrial structures vary considerably in the effect that driving forces have on shaping Nr inputs. Since cities are hot spots of consumption and pollution in a region or country, identifying the abundant datas on knowing N flows between cities would exert a profound impact on scales ranging from regional to national. Understanding the Nr metabolism in these megacities could offer valuable insights for city planners in formulating comprehensive methods to promote sustainable Nr management and reduce environmental pressures.

Mitigation is most effective for reducing the risks of communities as well as creating more resilient communities in cities. However, exploring the spatial prioritization for resources investment and evaluating the relative efficiency of different alternative risk reduction strategies are still challenges. In this study, we proposed an innovative methodology framework for exploring risk reduction strategies in large-scale urban areas. GIS spatial statistics technique is introduced to investigate global regional risk pattern as well as identify local risk hot spots in spatial scale, and scenario planning paradigm is used to explore the dynamically changing regional risk pattern and risk hot spots in temporal scale due to risk reduction. Moreover, scenario sets were developed to evaluate and analyze the effectiveness and cost of different alternative risk reduction strategies for trade-off. We then applied the methodology to a typical urban district of north China to demonstrate its utility. The results successfully obtained reveal the necessity of concerning dynamically changing nature of regional risk spatial pattern during the risk reduction process. The findings show that the methodology framework proposed in this study has potential to provide decision support for guiding future urban risk reduction and hazard mitigation planning.

In this study, hourly data from air temperature, wind speed and direction, accumulated precipitation, cloud cover and specific humidity (2009-2018) were integrated in a cluster analysis (K-means) in order to produce a LWT classification for Lisbon's urban area. This dataset was divided by daytime and nighttime and thermal periods, which were generated considering the annual cycle of air temperatures. Therefore, eight LWT sets were generated. Results show that N and NW LWT are quite frequent throughout the year, with a moderate speed (daily average of 4-6 m/s). In contrast, the frequency of rainy LWT is considerably lower, especially in summer (below 10%). Moreover, during this season the moisture content of the air masses is higher, particularly at night.

However, they have complex ecological consequences, especially their negative effects on birds. The East China coast is a key part of the East Asian-Australasian flyway (EAAF) for migratory waterbirds, and numerous wind farms have been or will be built in this region owing to high electricity demand and wind energy resources. However, little is known regarding the effects of large-scale wind farms of the East China coast on biodiversity conservation. The negative effects of wind farms on waterbirds that overwinter here could be reduced by understanding waterbird distribution and movement around wind turbines in these areas. From 2017 to 2019, we selected the Chongming Islands as our study area, which are one of the most important hot spots for migratory waterbirds of the East China coast and have sufficient wind generation potential to achieve energy sustainability, to study how to coordinate coastal wind farm development (existing and planned wind farms) and waterbird conservation (important waterbird habitats and buffer zone due to characteristic of waterbird activity). We identified four coastal natural wetlands of international importance for waterbirds according to 16 field surveys in 2017-2018. We found that over 63.16% species and 89.86% of waterbirds flew regularly across a dyke in Chongming Dongtan, where the wind farms are generally located, and used the natural intertidal wetland as a feeding ground and artificial habitat behind the dyke as a supplementary habitat for foraging and roosting. Additionally, with 4603 locations of 14 GPS/GSM tracked waterbirds (seven shorebirds and seven ducks) in Chongming Dongtan in 2018-2019, we further demonstrated that more than 60% of waterbird locations were within a distance of 800-1300 m from the dyke, and this distance could be defined as a buffer zone to protect waterbirds. Finally, we found that 67 existing wind turbines adjacent to four important coastal habitats on the Chongming Islands may influence waterbirds based on our finding of the buffer zone for waterbird conservation. We concluded that the settlement of wind farms should be avoided not only in important coastal natural wetlands for waterbird conservation but also in a proper buffer zone covering the artificial wetlands, such as aquaculture ponds and paddy fields adjoining these important natural wetlands.

Among all the surfaces, asphalt pavement noticed maximum surface temperature with maximum variability in both diurnal and temporal scales. Maximum assimilation with fewer albedo of asphalt surface along with drier soil and grass comes across maximum LST in the internal part of the city. In addition, traffic, pollution and anthropogenic heat emission supported warmer surface temperature of asphalt, grass and bare soil, which on the whole put into the growth of higher surface heat.

Regarding SO2 the major hot spots relate to regions with high population and large industrial facilities. Such an example is the city of Ekibastuz that hosts the biggest thermal power plants in the country and exhibits the higher SO2 CMD at national level. The annual average CMD in Ekibastuz reaches 2.5x10(-5) kg/m(2), whereas for the rest of the country respective values are 6 times lower. Other hotspots, mostly urban conglomerates such as Almaty and Nur-Sultan, experience high CMDs of SO2 in particular years, such as 2008. One of the main reasons for this behavior is the financial crisis of 2008, forcing the application of alternate heating sources based on cheap low-quality coal. Regarding HCHO, an oxygenated Volatile Organic Compound (VOC), the main hot spot is noticed over the city Atyrau, the oil capital of the country where two massive oil fields are located. The highest HCHO CMD (9x10(15) molecules/cm(2)) appears in the summertime due to secondary production as a result of the photo-oxidation of VOCs emitted by industrial sectors, oil refinery plants and vehicles. Strongly elevated HCHO amounts are also observed in Nur-Sultan in 2012 that could be due to the residential coal combustion and vehicle exhaust under poor winter dispersion conditions. Significant reductions in HCHO observed between 2012 and 2015 can be attributed to two significant measures implemented in the country in 2013 that aimed at the improvement of air quality: the introduction of the emission trading system (ETS) for greenhouse gases and Euro-4 standards for new vehicles entering the national vehicle fleet.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ANTHROPOGENIC EMISSIONS;SEASONAL-VARIATIONS;FORMALDEHYDE;AEROSOL,,

The friction characteristics and wear rate of this friction material sliding against 65Mn steel are obtained using Universal Material Tester-5. The friction pairs were subjected to two operating variables, which are sliding speed and temperature. The effect of these variables during the engagement process of the friction pairs is investigated. Knowing the normal applied force and dimension of the clutch disc, the dynamic friction coefficient was translated to friction torque capacity with time. It was found that instability can be excited at low operational conditions when the resulting friction coefficient is high. At 25 celcius, the dynamic friction torque oscillates with time likewise at 400 celcius. Generally, a more stable friction torque is obtained when the sliding speed is varied compared to varying the temperatures. Moreover, the influence of the operating temperatures and sliding speeds on thermal buckling and thermoelastic instability of the friction disc is the second consideration in this work. The onset of thermoelastic instability occurs when the sliding speed exceeded 200 r/min and the results for the growth rate of hot spots were found to agree well with the critical speed of the system. Also, thermal buckling was highly dependent on the temperature difference between the inner and outer radius of the friction disc.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,TRIBOLOGICAL PROPERTIES;M50 STEEL;WEAR;TORQUE;AL2O3;ZNO,,

The goal of this ecological cross-sectional study is to examine the demographic and economic nature of spatial hot and cold spots of SARS-CoV-2 rates in New York City and Chicago as of April 13, 2020 using data from the New York City Department of Health and Mental Hygiene, Illinois Department of Public Health, and the American Community Survey. In both cities, cold spots (clusters of low SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas as identified by the Getis-Ord (GI*) statistic) demonstrated social determinants of health characteristics typically associated with better health outcomes and the ability to maintain physical distance (""social distancing""). These neighborhoods tended to be wealthier, have higher educational attainment, higher proportions of non-Hispanic white residents, and more workers in managerial occupations (allpvalues < 0.01 using Wilcoxon two-sample test). Hot spots (clusters of high SARS-CoV-2 rate ZIP code tabulation areas) had similarities as well, such as lower rates of college graduates and higher proportions of people of color. It also appears that household size (more people per household), rather than overall population density (people per square mile), is more strongly associated with hot spots. New York City had an average of 3.0 people per household in hot spots and 2.1 in cold spots (p < 0.01), and Chicago had 2.8 people per household in hot spots and 2.0 in cold spots (p = 0.03). However, hotspots were located in neighborhoods that were significantly less dense (New York City: 22,900 people per square mile in hot spots and 68,900 in cold spots (p < 0.01); Chicago: 10,000 people per square mile in hot spots and 23,400 in cold spots (p = 0.03)). Findings suggest important differences between the cities' hot spots as well. NYC hot spots can be described as working-class and middle-income communities, perhaps indicative of greater concentrations of service workers and other occupations (including those classified as ""essential services"" during the pandemic) that may not require a college degree but pay wages above poverty levels. Chicago's hot spot neighborhoods, on the other hand, are among the city's most vulnerable, low-income neighborhoods with extremely high rates of poverty, unemployment, and non-Hispanic Black residents.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ENVIRONMENTAL-HEALTH;RACISM;Socioeconomic Factors;New York City;Chicago,,

The area surrounding two steel factories, a cement plant, an industrial area and the city core were considered as potential hot spots of metal(loid) contamination. Significant anthropogenic enrichments of Cd, Pb and Zn in relation to local baseline were identified for the soil (median Enrichment Factors of 7, 15 and 8, respectively) and road dusts around the steel factory located at Velestino area. The high contents of As, Sb and Tl in the soil and road dust around the cement plant are attributed to natural sources of contamination associated with adjacent mineralization. The soil samples in the city core exhibited moderate enrichments with respect to typical tracers (Pb, Zn) of anthropogenic contamination in urban areas. Anthropogenic influences in terms of metal (loid) concentrations were more pronounced for the road and house dust material. The Pb isotopic ratios of soil (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.154 to 1.194), road dust (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.144 to 1.174) and house dust (Pb-206/Pb-207 = 1.129 to 1.171) were between those of the local bedrock and anthropogenic Pb sources. Industrial Pb from the steel plant was the predominant anthropogenic Pb source with relative contributions of similar to 49% for the soil, similar to 42% for the road dust and similar to 44% for the house dust samples. For the road and house dustmaterial, the geochemical signature obtained from Pb isotopic compositions and elemental ratios suggests additional contributors from vehicular emissions. The results of this study demonstrate the suitability of soil to trace natural and anthropogenic impacts in industrial areas and the sensitivity of the road and house dust material to record anthropogenic (industrial and vehicular-derived) contamination in such environments.

Researchers rode along with officers in two of the treatment conditions, assignment of marked patrol cars to the predicted grids, and assignment of unmarked patrol cars to the grids. This involved keeping notes, observing, and speaking with officers and supervisors about the experiment. Limitations of the technology, including spatial, temporal, and spatiotemporal inaccuracies and/or unresponsiveness conflicted with officers' craft-based knowledge. Concerns about the technology marginalising their expertise and interfering with peer-based responsiveness norms surfaced as well. These reported concerns could reflect conflicts generated by the technology between the bureaucratic, normative, and safety orders within police subcultures. Notwithstanding those concerns, some officers pointed out how the prediction technology helped deepen their craft-based knowledge.

Twenty-five VOCs were regularly monitored and analyzed with the GC-FID system. The sampling periods were carried out for seven-day periods during March and August 2010. In the study, mean Sigma VOC concentrations were found to be as high 67 and 51 mu g m(-3) for the winter and summer seasons, respectively. Median concentrations of benzene, toluene, ethylbenzene, m,p-xylene and o-xylene were 2.6, 11, 1.30, 1.80 and 0.73 mu g m(-3), respectively. Although there were some changes between concentrations of VOC groups between the summer and winter campaigns, differences were not dramatic. Winter-to-summer ratios of the target compounds ranged from 0.2 (1,2,4-trimethylbenzene) to 9 (hexane). Most of the target compounds have higher concentrations in winter.

The measurements of total gaseous mercury (TGM) and PM2.5-bound mercury (PBM) were performed at an urban station in Zabrze and a rural station in Zloty Potok, in 2014-2015. Both sites are located in Silesia, considered one of the European air pollution hot-spots. TGM was measured on-line (Tekran 2537). PM(2.5)samples were taken with the use of low volume samplers. Hg contents in PM were determined by the CVAAS method following thermal decomposition. The median concentrations of TGM and PBM in Zabrze were 2.48 ng m(-3)and 37.87 pg m(-3), respectively; meanwhile in Zloty Potok, these were 1.69 ng m(-3)and 27.82 pg m(-3), respectively. Clearly, seasonal variability of TGM and PBM concentrations were observed, reflecting the importance of Hg and PM emissions from coal combustion for power and heating purposes. Health risk assessment was performed using a deterministic approach by the most conservative exposure scenario. The obtained HQ ratios and the cumulative HI indexes were below the limit value (<1). This means an unlikely health hazard due mercury inhalation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,HEALTH-RISK ASSESSMENT;ATMOSPHERIC MERCURY;MONITORING STATIONS;RURAL-AREAS;URBAN;SPECIATION;PATTERNS;SITE;EMISSIONS;NEVADA,,

Landscape pattern analysis was undertaken to explore the correlation between patch metrics and LST with resolutions from 100 m to 1 km. The results showed that (1) the high-temperature zones were mainly distributed on built-up land; the area of LST hot spots increased from 16% (2001) to 23% (2017). (2) The mean LST of each LULC type was calculated, indicating that the temperature of forestland was more than 5 degrees C lower than that of built-up land. (3) The landscape patterns of different land use types exhibited various effects on LST in terms of magnitude and importance. Considering the significance of the landscape indexes, it is necessary to avoid a large-scale layout of a single built-up land type when planning an urban environment. It is thus recommended that multiple contiguous forestlands be planned to mitigate urban heat island (UHI) effects. Furthermore, the landscape patterns and structure of different LULC types have various effects on LST and need to be explored in fine detail. This study helped reveal the impact of different LULC types on LST and provides urban planners in the PRD with optional schemes for mitigating the impacts of urbanization on the UHI.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SPLIT-WINDOW ALGORITHM;THERMAL-PROPERTIES;URBAN EXPANSION;RETRIEVAL;AREA;CITY;MITIGATION;IMPACTS;PATTERN;INDEX,,

High-risk areas of FMD occurrence are defined as local clusters or hot spots, where the frequency of disease occurrence is higher than expected. An issue in the FMD detection study is in identifying a spatial pattern deviated significantly from the expected value under the null hypothesis that no spatial process is investigated. While identifying geographic clusters is challenging to reveal the causes of disease outbreak, it is most useful to detect and monitor potential areas of risk occurrence and suggest a further in-depth investigation. This study extended a traditional score statistic (SC) that has limited to identify the spatial pattern by proposing a spatiotemporal score statistic (STSC) that incorporates a temporal component into the SC approach. STSC, a local spatial statistic, was utilized to detect clusters around the known foci with a latent period. This study demonstrated STSC could better exploit the advantage of the original SC and improve the cluster detection due to the latent time component. The empirical results of STSC are expected to provide more useful policy implications with agencies in charge of preventing and controlling the spread of epidemics when deciding where to concentrate the limited resources available.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,CLUSTERS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;FARMS;Disease Outbreaks;Mouth Diseases;Korea,,

Ecosystem services are heterogeneous across landscapes. However, how human activities, which cause disturbances to ecosystem services, relate to such heterogeneity has not been well studied and thus necessarily constraining our ability to manage ecosystems sustainably. Based on land use/land cover data, this study addressed the research gap by running two inter-related analyses on the datasets of the study area, i.e., Chuandong, China. The first analysis involves identifying distinctive heterogeneous units of ecosystem service values using Getis-Ord Gi*. The second analysis involves measuring the impacts of human disturbances on ecosystem service values and their variations over every five years between 1990 and 2015, using linear regression and spatial regression models. The result of the first analysis identified heterogeneous ecosystem service units of hot-spots, cold-spots, and random areas. The hot-spots mainly clustered in relative inaccessibility land at higher terrain gradients in the east of the study area. The cold-spots overlapped extensively with built-up areas and farmland at lower terrain gradients in the west of the study area. Random areas distributed mainly in the middle part of the study area. This heterogeneity also existed temporally. Ecosystem service values in the study area decreased from 1990 to 2000 but reversed the trend after 2000. The result of the second analysis revealed that the impacts of hot-spots, cold-spots, and random areas on the relationship between ecosystem service values and human disturbances vary. Specifically, there was a negatively linear relationship between ecosystem service values and the integrated indicator of human disturbances, which was the strongest in random areas, followed by cold-spots and hot-spots. In addition, spatial spillover effect is explicit in the relationship between ecosystem service values and three specific factors of human disturbances, i.e., terrain index, population, and gross domestic product. They varied significantly between units: the terrain index had a positive externality on ecosystem service values with cold-spots and random areas but negative externality with hot-spots; population imposed a more negative externality on ecosystem service values when in proximity to random areas than cold-spots and hot-spots; the externality between gross domestic product and ecosystem service values exhibited irregular inverse 'U' shape, which was below the 'X-axis' in cold-spots but throughout the 'X-axis' in hot-spots and random areas. The findings of this study have potential policy implications in improving ecosystem sustainability through harmonizing the environment and human activities. (C) 2020 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we describe the results of a nationwide survey in the UK, designed to assess which pests and diseases gardeners consider the most important, and whether these vary across regions of the country. We found that slugs and snails and various aphids are considered the most important pests, while late blight and rose black spot are the most important diseases. Most importantly, we concluded that inferences drawn from rankings of pest and disease incidence based on enquiry data should not be taken as a proxy for importance.

We investigated the occurrence of human-wildlife conflicts in Krakow city, southern Poland, based on recorded conflict incidents with wild animals in three categories, i.e., animal-vehicle collisions, intrusion to property, and damages. The three most common conflict species were red fox, roe deer and wild boar. We analysed the spatial and temporal distribution of the HWC. The results of the study can be used to identify locations of potential HWC hot spots in the city and provide information for mitigation actions. Efforts to reduce human-wildlife-conflict are integral to wildlife management and conservation in urban habitats. In our study, we identified the HWC situations in urban areas of Krakow city, based on animal-vehicle collisions, intrusion to property, and damages. Hot spot analysis and Moran's Index were used to identify the location of maximum potential conflict. We analysed 2512 incidents in which animals (of which 85% included mammals and 15% birds) were involved in conflict situations between 2007 and 2013. A significant seasonal variation was observed among the animals. We also identified roe deer (50.23%), red fox (22.80%) and wild boar (11.40%), as the three prominent conflicted animals. Getis-Ord Gi* analysis was used to identify spatial clusters of conflict. A significant spatial association was found in the location of clusters of hot spots in specific land-use based on Moran's Index. Hot spots of roe deer and wild boar were high in grasslands and in forest and for red fox in built-up area. The results underscore the notion that conservation and wildlife management efforts must take into account differences in the seasonality of HWC among species.

In this research, we use spatially referenced mobile phone data to measure the size and activity patterns of various types of ambient population, and further investigate the link between urban larceny-theft and population with multiple demographic and activity characteristics.

We measured the particle number-size distributions with a Scanning Mobility Particle Sizer (SMPS) in the urban environment of Kanpur, India, and discovered that particle bursts occurred on 82% of the observation days, indicating that new particles frequently formed from gaseous precursors despite the relatively high concentrations of pre-existing particles. During such events, Aitken-mode particles contributed more than 50% of the total particle mass. Additionally, we used a high-resolution time-of-flight aerosol mass spectrometer (HR-ToF-AMS) to assess chemical changes in the sub-micron particles during NPF events. Because the HR-ToF-AMS can not detect particles smaller than 40 nm in diameter, however, it was not possible to investigate the chemistry driving the NPF. Our results indicated that oxygenated organic aerosols (OAs) constituted almost 77%the largest fractionof the sub-micron particles. The m/z 57 ion (C4H9+), a tracer of hydrocarbon-like OA (HOA), displayed significantly enhanced signal intensity during all of the NPF event days. Moreover, the increased proportion of organic ions, m/z 44 (CO2+), on these days suggested the presence of less volatile, highly oxidized OAs (LV-OOAs), revealing that the growth of new particles was mainly due to the condensation of low-volatility organic species. The substantially elevated signal intensity of amines (viz., CHN+, CH4N+, C2H4N+, C3H8N+, and C5H12N+) in the sub-micron aerosols during NPF further demonstrated that these nitrogen-containing organic compounds may have played a critical role in these events.

This is an empirical formula based on upwind-downwind measurement of PM10 concentrations and is dependent solely on the silt loading of the pavement and the weight of vehicles. A number of upwind-downwind studies conducted in urban areas to validate this algorithm have been generally inconclusive because the PM10 concentration difference between upwind and downwind often is within the measurement uncertainty. In the approach presented here PM10 concentrations were measured directly behind a moving vehicle in order to improve the measurement sensitivity for estimating the emission rates for vehicles on paved roads. Optical sensors were used to measure PM10 concentrations with a time resolution of approximately 10 s. Sensors were mounted in the front of the vehicle and behind it in the well-mixed wake. A special inlet probe was designed to allow isokinetic sampling under varying speed conditions. As a first approximation the emission rate was calculated by multiplying the PM10 concentration difference between the front and rear of a moving vehicle by the frontal area of the vehicle. This technique is also useful for quickly surveying large areas and for investigating hot spots on roadways caused by greater than normal deposition of PM10 forming debris.

It is examined how inspirations from counter-insurgency strategies are implemented in policing the war on drugs and discussed how this form of policing is negotiated and what implications it produces on the ground. In doing so, the article asks, 'how have counter-insurgency policing strategies transformed urban space and the possibility of life in the poorer sections of Manila'?

Understanding historic spatial and temporal patterns of such fragmentation is important for habitat and biological conservation, ecosystem management and urban planning. Despite their potential value, Local Indicators of Spatial Autocorrelation (LISA) measures have not been sufficiently exploited in monitoring the spatial and temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation of vegetation patterns in urban areas. LISA statistics are an important structural measure that indicates the presence of outliers, zones of similarity (hot spots) and of dissimilarity (cold spots) at proximate locations, hence they could be used to explicitly capture spatial patterns that are clustered, dispersed or random. In this study, we applied landscape metrics, LISA indices to analyse the temporal variability in clustering and fragmentation patterns of vegetation patches in Harare metropolitan city, Zimbabwe using Landsat series data for 1994, 2001 and 2017. Analysis of landscape metrics showed an increase in the fragmentation of vegetation patches between 1994-2017 as shown by the decrease in mean patch size, an increase in number of patches, edge density and shape complexity of vegetation patches. The study further demonstrates the utility of LISA indices in identifying key hot spot and cold spots. Comparatively, the highly vegetated northern parts of the city were characterised by significantly high positive spatial autocorrelation (p < 0.05) of vegetation patches. Conversely, more dispersed vegetation patches were found in the highly and densely urbanized western, eastern and southern parts of the city.

Potential ecological risk index (RI), pollution index (PI) and geo-accumulation index (Igeo) were applied to evaluate the heavy metal pollution level, and the carcinogenic risk (RI) and hazard index (HI) were calculated to estimate the human health risk. The geographic information system maps clearly reveal the hot spots of heavy metal spatial distribution. Principle component analysis (PCA) and cluster analysis (CA) classified heavy metals into three groups. The metal Zn and Pb originate from the traffic emission, while Cd, Cr, Fe, Mn, Ni and Sb primarily come from industrial activities. These two pathways were the major source of heavy metals pollution by positive matrix factorization (PMF). The Igeo and PI values of heavy metals were decreased in the following order: Cd > Sb > Zn > Fe > Pb > Cu > Cr > Sn > Mn > Ni. The RI index showed the heavy metals were moderate to very high potential ecological risk. The HI values for children and adults presented a decreasing order of Cr > Pb > Ni > Cu > Cd > Zn. The HI also predicted a possibility of non-carcinogenic risk for children living in urban areas in comparison with adults.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"DIFFERENT FUNCTIONAL AREAS;URBAN STREET DUST;HEALTH-RISK;SOURCE        APPORTIONMENT;ECOLOGICAL RISK;TRACE-ELEMENTS;POLLUTION        CHARACTERISTICS;ORAL BIOACCESSIBILITY;POPULATION-DENSITY;XIANDAO        DISTRICT;Risk Assessment;Metals, Heavy;Dust",,

Future extreme heat events are reported to be more frequent, long-lasting, and intense. The intense exposure to hot temperatures can cause an excess of heat-related deaths, leading to an increasing risk of heal-related health. In reducing Heat Health Risk (HHR), the use of fine-scale evidence-based mapping of heat-related health risk index (HHRI) and its underlying contributors is essential for policy-making and site-specific action plans. However, its use is still considered to be at an early stage, especially in high-density cities like Hong Kong. This study conducted a spatially explicit assessment of HHR in Hong Kong and constructed a HHRI based on indicators categorized through Principle Component Analysis (PCA) into four meaningful components representing social/language, social isolation, socioeconomic, and urbanization/environmental risks. The applicability of the index was validated against heat-related mortality data at the community level. The community-level maps of HHRI and its subcomponents revealed that portions of Kowloon Peninsula had always suffered exceptionally high HHR ten years ago and after, but the hot spots and problematic communities experienced displacement and the dominant underlying factors of their HHR also varied. Results also showed that HHRI correlated fairly well with the heat-related deaths ratio (R-2 = 0.60) at the community level for most of Hong Kong (62.33% of all communities that contain 81.69% of total population). Our analysis results helped generate an evidence-based index to assess HHR in high-density cities like Hong Kong and provided fine-scale maps of the index and its subcomponents, with the aim of benefiting site-specific policy making and optimizing the existing action plans.

However, there is lack of information about the completeness of death registration at the sub-national level of Egypt. The current study was conducted to estimate the completeness of death registration at the national and sub-national levels of Egypt, to investigate the spatial patterns of the completeness, and to examine the factors that influence it. Methods Data from the Central Agency for Public Mobilization and Statistics (CAPMAS, 2018) and Egypt Demographic and Health Survey (EDHS 2008, 2014) were used to estimate the completeness of death registration using an empirical method (random-effects models); hot spot analysis was conducted using Moran's I and Getis-Ord Gi*; and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model has been also carried out. Results The study estimates show that Egypt has 96% completeness of death registration, and all governorates have completeness of more than 90% except for Beni-Suef, Menia, Aswan, Suhag, Luxor, ELWadi ELGidid, and South Sinai. According to sex, the death registration of females is slightly better than that of males (96.8% compared to 95.4%). Concerning residence, urban area has almost complete death registration compared to rural area (99.5% and 85.4%, respectively). Hot spot analysis shows that all hot spots are centered on the north of Egypt, while all cold spots are focused on the south. However, according to the geographically weighted regression (GWR) model, poverty, illiteracy, and health office density are considered major factors for the completeness of death registration. Conclusion Although the completeness in Egypt is almost 100%, this analysis suggests that it may not be, and that it could be somewhat lower in some rural areas. However, there is uncertainty in the sub-national estimates because deaths are only reported by place of occurrence and not place of usual residence. Thus, efforts should focus on improving the quality of data of the vital registration system in some rural areas and in lower Egyptian governorates.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,REGRESSION;Egypt,,

NSC witnessed increasing concentrations of both PMs with increase in height. In SC, the vertical concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10 were increasing and decreasing with height, respectively. However, SCV recorded improper vertical trend with height. The statistical analysis shows a strong influence of wind speed and ambient temperature over the vertical trend of PMs, in addition to street geometry. The hazard quotient values for infants and senior citizens were two folds higher in SC and SCV than in NSC. Cancer risk estimates of PM2.5 were above the acceptable limit of 10(-6) for all age groups invariably with height and street geometries. The concentration of PMs surpassed the limits prescribed by Indian National Ambient Air Quality Standards in SC (38% of the observations) and SCV (50% of the observations) at different heights. Furthermore, all the observed PMs in three street geometries surpassed the World Health Organization guidelines at all the measured heights.

Understanding the joint spatial clustering of CVDs and associated risk factors to determine areas in need of enhanced integrated interventions would help develop targeted, cost-effective and productive mediations. We estimated joint spatial associations and clustering patterns of 2 CVDs (stroke and heart attack) and 3 risk factors (hypertension, high blood cholesterol (HBC) and smoking) among adults in South Africa. Methods: We used cross-sectional secondary adult (15-64-year olds) health data from the South African Demographic Health Survey 2016. Age and gender standardized disease incidence ratios were analyzed using joint spatial global and local bivariate Moran's Index statistics. Results: We found significantly positive univariate spatial clustering for stroke (Moran; s Index = 0.128), smoking (0.606) hypertension (0.236) and high blood cholesterol (0.385). Smoking and high blood cholesterol (0.366), smoking and stroke (0.218) and stroke and high blood cholesterol (0.184) were the only bivariate outcomes with significant bivariate clustering. There was a joint stroke-smoking local ""hot spots"" cluster among four districts in the urban western part of the country (City of Cape Town; Cape Winelands; Overberg and Eden) and a joint ""cold spots"" cluster in the rural north-western part of the country. Similar joint ""hot spots"" clustering was found for stroke and high blood cholesterol, which also had ""cold spots"" cluster in the rural east-central part of the country. Smoking and high blood cholesterol had a ""hot spots"" cluster among five districts in the urban western part of the country (City of Cape Town; Cape Winelands; Overberg; Eden, and West Coast) and ""cold spots"" around the rural districts in east-southern parts of the country. Conclusions: Our study showed that districts tended to co-cluster based on the rates of CVDs and risk factors, where higher rates were found in urban places than in rural areas. These findings are suggestive of a more contagious and spatial diffusion process among interdependent districts in urban districts. Urbanization or rurality needs to be considered when intervention initiatives are implemented with more general approaches in rural areas. The finding of ""hot spot"" co-clusters in urban areas means that integrated intervention programmes aimed at reducing the risk of CVDs and associated risk factors would be cost-effective and more productive.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA;SEX-DIFFERENCES;HYPERTENSION;PREVALENCE;BURDEN;POPULATION;Cardiovascular Diseases;South Africa;Risk Factors,,

Hot spot increases in 2014 to 9 areas for nighttime incidents while daytime events also increased to 10 areas. While 2015 showed that the number of hot spots that occurred at night reduced to 5 areas and daytime incidents also recorded the same number of hot spots during the night incidents. Hot spot areas also frequently identified in urban areas and high population density such as Jelutong, Dato Keramat, Tanjung Tokong dan Sungai Nibong.

The influences of ecological projects on wind erosion and ecosystem services has been subsequently assessed by using those modifications brought on via the LUCCs (e.g., conversion from cropland to grassland/woodland) during the ecological construction. The results indicated that the SWEM showed a decline and ecosystem services which included carbon storage, water retention, and air quality regulation exhibited growth driven by using both local climate exchanges and human activities such as ecological projects. Excluding the effects of climate factors, the LUCCs stemming from ecological projects caused a total SWEM decrease of 3.77 million tons during 2000-2015, of which approximately 70% was prompted by the way of the transition from desert to sparse grassland. And from this transition, ecosystem services including both water retention and aboveground net primary productivity manifest a general increase. The sub-regions of desert grassland in Bayannur, Ordos Sandy Land, and Otindag Sandy Land were hot spots for wind erosion declines and ecosystem service enhancements induced by the ecological projects.

Cheng Liu from the University of Science and Technology of China and his colleagues reported the first successful retrieval of nitrogen dioxide from the GF-5 orbiter thanks to crucial adjustments to calibration algorithms. The satellite's payload Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) uses visible spectroscopic measurements to detect nitrogen dioxide in the atmosphere, which can be used to identify the spatial distribution of pollution emissions on the Earth. To overcome on-orbit issues including detector saturation, the team has optimized the spectral retrieval settings by spectral precalibration, fitting wavelength adjustment, reference spectrum selection, etc. Comparisons to other satellite and ground measurements revealed the optimization effort yielded reliable results for monitoring pollution levels.        The Environmental Trace Gases Monitoring Instrument (EMI) is the first Chinese satellite-borne UV-Vis spectrometer aiming to measure the distribution of atmospheric trace gases on a global scale. The EMI instrument onboard the GaoFen-5 satellite was launched on 9 May 2018. In this paper, we present the tropospheric nitrogen dioxide (NO2) vertical column density (VCD) retrieval algorithm dedicated to EMI measurement. We report the first successful retrieval of tropospheric NO2 VCD from the EMI instrument. Our retrieval improved the original EMI NO2 prototype algorithm by modifying the settings of the spectral fit and air mass factor calculations to account for the on-orbit instrumental performance changes. The retrieved EMI NO2 VCDs generally show good spatiotemporal agreement with the satellite-borne Ozone Monitoring Instrument and TROPOspheric Monitoring Instrument (correlation coefficient R of similar to 0.9, bias < 50%). A comparison with ground-based MAX-DOAS (Multi-Axis Differential Optical Absorption Spectroscopy) observations also shows good correlation with an R of 0.82. The results indicate that the EMI NO2 retrieval algorithm derives reliable and precise results, and this algorithm can feasibly produce stable operational products that can contribute to global air pollution monitoring.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,NO2;RETRIEVAL;EMISSIONS;TROPOMI;CHINA;ALGORITHMS;CHEMISTRY;CLIMATE;QUALITY;HAZE;Nitrogen Dioxide;Nitrogen,,

The PM2.5-associated hourly hazardous airborne element (HAE) concentrations ranged between 56 ng/m(3) and 4374 ng/m(3), accounting for an average of 0.2 +/- 0.1 % of PM2.5, which were lower than or comparable with those reported in previous studies. Different from the traditional filter sampling offline analysis, dynamic variations and evolution of particulate HAEs were illustrated based on hourly observations, which showed that the concentrations of most HAEs declined with increasing mixed layer height (MLH) as expected, while slight increases in the Cr and Pb concentrations were observed when the MLH increased from 250 m to 500 m. Compared with the values in spring, As, Cr, Hg, Mn, Ni, Pb and Se increased by 135.0 %, 67.2 %, 110.1 %, 36.4 %, 32.4 %, 185.6 % and 63.9 % in winter, respectively. Based on hourly elemental data, the more robust source analysis showed that industrial emissions contributed substantially to Cr, Hg, Ni and Se (58.5 %, 42.7 %, 65.0 % and 62.0 %, respectively), vehicular sources primarily accounted for Mn (41.1 %) and almost all sources except for dust contributed equally to the Pb loading. A nonparametric wind regression analysis applied to 1-h HAE concentrations pinpointed distinct hot spots (high concentrations) for all HAEs except Cd in the northeast wind sector at wind speeds of approximately 0 - 6 km/h. Based on a potential source contribution function analysis, the areas in western China with intense coal consumption strongly contributed to the loading of As in Beijing. Cr, Hg, Ni, Pb and Se showed source areas that were similar to but larger than that of As; additionally, these elements exhibited moderate and strong hotspots in Shanxi Province with strong coal consumption and industrial production. Ni clearly originated from the coastal areas where the effect of shipping activities was intense.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;TRACE-ELEMENTS;HEAVY-METALS;SOURCE        APPORTIONMENT;AMBIENT AIR;LONG-TERM;CHEMICAL CHARACTERISTICS;ESTIMATING UNCERTAINTY;POLLUTION EPISODES;SPATIAL VARIATION;Seasons,,

However, loss of coastal ecosystems reduces their mitigating effect on coastal flood risks in many places around the world. Here, we identify global urban hot spots exposed to storm surge flood risks, where conservation of existing coastal ecosystems can contribute to nature-based risk mitigation. We present a global procedure identifying the most likely pathways followed by storm surges from the open sea toward 136 cities around the world and quantifying the extent of mangrove forests, salt marshes, seagrass meadows, and coral reefs along these storm surge pathways. Instead of being locally precise, our procedure aims to be globally applicable, in order to identify cities around the world where ecosystems can have a positive effect on storm surge risk mitigation and where further local-scale, more precise assessments are advised. Our results show that cities that combine large flood-exposed populations (> 400,000 people exposed to 1-in-100-year storm events) and large potential for nature-based risk mitigation (> 200 km2 of coastal ecosystems) are located in large river deltas and estuaries, such as Khulna (Ganges-Brahmaputra delta, Bangladesh), Guayaquil (Guayas delta, Ecuador), Ho Chi Minh City (Mekong delta, Vietnam), and New Orleans (Mississippi Delta, USA). Here, conservation of mangroves and salt marshes plays a key role. Cities with large flood-exposed populations and/or assets, but few ecosystems, are either located directly adjacent to coastlines or where former wetlands have been reclaimed, especially in European and Asian cities. Overall, 75% of the studied cities benefit from flood risk mitigation by present ecosystems and from additional ecosystem services. Hence, our study identifies global urban hot spots where more detailed local studies are advised on the effectiveness of conservation and (re-)creation of coastal ecosystems as a sustainable strategy for nature-based mitigation of increasing coastal flood risks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SEA-LEVEL;CLIMATE-CHANGE;MANAGED REALIGNMENT;MANGROVE FORESTS;TROPICAL CYCLONES;SALT-MARSHES;PROTECTION;WETLANDS;VULNERABILITY;COMMUNITIES;Ecosystem,,

Black carbon (BC) is the dominant absorbing aerosol, whose absorption potential is determined mainly by its microphysical properties, including its concentration, size and mixing state with other aerosol components. The Indo-Gangetic Plain (IGP) is one of the regional aerosol hot spots with diverse sources, both natural and anthropogenic, but still the information on the mixing state of the IGP aerosols, especially BC, is limited and a significant source of uncertainty in understanding their climatic implications. In this context, we present the results from intensive measurements of refractory BC (r(BC)) carried out over Bhubaneswar, an urban site in the eastern coast of India, which experiences contrasting air masses (the IGP outflow or coastal/marine air masses) in different seasons. This study helps to elucidate the microphysical characteristics of BC over this region and delineates the IGP outflow from the other air masses. The observations were carried out as part of South West Asian Aerosol Monsoon Interactions (SWAAMI) collaborative field experiment during July 2016-May 2017, using a single-particle soot photometer (SP2) that uses a laser-induced incandescence technique to measure the mass and mixing state of individual BC particles and an aerosol chemical speciation monitor (ACSM) to infer the possible coating material. Results highlighted the distinctiveness in aerosol microphysical properties in the IGP air masses. BC mass concentration was highest during winter (December-February) (similar to 1.94 +/- 1.58 mu g m(-3)), when the prevailing air masses were mostly of IGP origin, followed by post-monsoon (October-November) (mean similar to 1.34 +/- 1.40 pg m(-3)). The mass median diameter (MMD) of the BC mass size distributions was in the range 0.190-0.195 pm, suggesting mixed sources of BC, and, further, higher values (similar to 1.3-1.8) of bulk relative coating thickness (RCT) (ratio of optical and core diameters) were seen, indicating a significant fraction of highly coated BC aerosols in the IGP outflow. During the pre-monsoon (March-May), when marine/coastal air masses prevailed, BC mass concentration was lowest (similar to 0.82 +/- 0.84 pg m(-3)), and larger BC cores (MMD > 0.210 mu m) were seen, suggesting distinct source processes, while RCT was similar to 1.2-1.3, which may translate into higher extent of absolute coating on BC cores, which may have crucial regional climate implications. During the summer monsoon (July-September), BC size distributions were dominated by smaller cores (MMD <= 0.185 mu m), with the lowest coating indicating fresher BC, likely from fossil fuel sources. A clear diurnal variation pattern of BC and RCT was noticed in all the seasons, and daytime peak in RCT suggested enhanced coating on BC due to the condensable coating material originating from photochemistry. Examination of submicrometre aerosol chemical composition highlighted that the IGP outflow was dominated by organics (47 %-49 %), and marine/coastal air masses contained higher amounts of sulfate (41 %-47 %), while ammonium and nitrate were seen in minor amounts, with significant concentrations only during the IGP air mass periods. The diurnal pattern of sulfate resembled that of the RCT of r(BC) particles, whereas organic mass showed a pattern similar to that of the r(BC) mass concentration.        Seasonally, the coating on BC showed a negative association with the mass concentration of sulfate during the pre-monsoon season and with organics during the post-monsoon season. These are the first experimental data on the mixing state of BC from a long time series over the Indian region and include new information on black carbon in the IGP outflow region. These data help in improving the understanding of regional BC microphysical characteristics and their climate implications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,PARTICLE SOOT PHOTOMETER;OPTICAL-PROPERTIES;LIGHT-ABSORPTION;PHYSICAL-PROPERTIES;ORGANIC AEROSOLS;BOUNDARY-LAYER;HYGROSCOPIC        PROPERTIES;SOURCE APPORTIONMENT;TIBETAN PLATEAU;GANGETIC PLAIN;African Continental Ancestry Group;Seasons;India,,

Stroke is known to show spatial clustering at the state and county levels, but it is not known if clusters are present within city boundaries.        Methods: We performed a geospatial analysis of the prevalence of stroke within 500 major cities in the United States using the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 500 Cities Project. For each city, we calculated the Moran's I statistic, which looks for evidence of spatial clustering, and used Monte Carlo simulation to assess for clustering significance.        Results: The mean overall crude prevalence of self-reported history of stroke at the city level was 2.8% (IQR 2.4-3.2%). Monte Carlo simulations of spatial patterns of stroke were successfully performed for 497 cities, of which 136 (27.3%) showed significant spatial clustering at the neighborhood level. All nine cities with more than one million inhabitants in 2010 showed significant spatial clustering.        Conclusions: This is the first study to demonstrate that stroke shows clustering at the neighborhood level within many major cities in the United States and within all of the largest cities. Understanding where stroke clusters exist within cities can form the basis of optimizing emergency medical services deployment and improving systems of stroke care. (c) 2019 Elsevier Inc.

Our objective in this study was to investigate the concentrations, fractions (dissolved and particulate), and loads of OC in a residential catchment (3.89 ha drainage area) located in Florida, United States. The outlet of the stormwater pipe draining the residential catchment was instrumented with an automated sampler, a flowmeter, and a rain gauge. The rainfall and runoff samples collected over 25 storm events during the 2016 wet season (June to September) were analyzed for dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and total organic carbon (TOC), with particulate OC (POC) calculated as the difference between TOC and DOC. Mean concentration of DOC was 2.3 +/- 1.7 mg L-1 and POC was 0.3 +/- 0.3 mg L-1 in the rainfall, whereas DOC was 10.5 +/- 6.20 mg L-1 and POC was 2.00 +/- 4.05 mg L-1 in the stormwater runoff. Concentrations of DOC were higher during the rising limb of the hydrograph in 15 out of 25 storm events, suggesting flushing of DOC, with an increase in the amount of runoff, from the landscape sources in the residential catchment. The estimated total export of OC during the 2016 wet season was 66.0 kg ha(-1), of which DOC was 56.9 kg ha(-1) (86.2% of TOC), and POC was 9.1 kg ha(-1) (13.8% of TOC). High concentrations and loads of OC, especially DOC, in the stormwater runoff imply that residential catchments in urban watersheds are hot-spots of DOC influx to water bodies. Reducing DOC transport in the urban landscapes is complex and require identifying the origin of DOC and then using site -specific targeted approaches to mitigate DOC loss.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,EXPORT;MECHANISMS;MATTER,,

Using a unique historical fire incident dataset (2002-2013), this paper is intended to explore the urban fire dynamics and its association with urban growth in Nanjing, China, with a geographical information system (GIS)-based spatial analytics and remote sensing (RS) techniques. A new method is proposed to define a range of fire hot spots characterizing different phases of fire incident evolution, which are compared with the urban growth in the same periods. The results suggest that the fire events have been largely concentrated in the city proper and meanwhile expanding towards the suburbs, which has a similar temporal trend to the growth of population and urban land at the city level particularly since 2008. Most intensifying and persistent fire hot spots are found in the central districts, which have limited urban expansion but high population densities. Most new hot spots are located in the suburban districts, which have seen both rapid population growth and urban expansion in recent years. However, the analysis at a finer spatial scale (500 m x 500 m) shows no evidences of an explicit connection between the locations of new fire hot spots and recently developed urban land. The findings can inform future urban and emergency planning with respect to the deployment of fire and rescue resources, ultimately improving urban fire safety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,SOUTH-WALES;LAND;PATTERNS;EXPLORE;China,,

Some sources are legacy, such as heavy metals accumulated in soils, and some are current, such as particulate matter. Because the global burden of disease from pollution is so high, it is important to identify legacy and current sources and to develop and implement effective techniques to reduce human exposure. But many limitations exist in our understanding of the distribution and transport processes of pollutants themselves, as well as the complicated overprint of human behavior and susceptibility.        New approaches are being developed to identify and eliminate pollution in multiple environments. Community-scale detection of geogenic arsenic and fluoride in Bangladesh is helping to map the distribution of these harmful elements in drinking water. Biosensors such as bees and their honey are being used to measure heavy metal contamination in cities such as Vancouver and Sydney. Drone-based remote sensors are being used to map metal hot spots in soils from former mining regions in Zambia and Mozambique. The explosion of low-cost air monitors has allowed researchers to build dense air quality sensing networks to capture ephemeral and local releases of harmful materials, building on other developments in personal exposure sensing. And citizen science is helping communities without adequate resources measure their own environments and in this way gain agency in controlling local pollution exposure sources and/or alerting authorities to environmental hazards. The future of GeoHealth will depend on building on these developments and others to protect a growing population from multiple pollution exposure risks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,BLOOD LEAD LEVELS;AIR-POLLUTION;ISOTOPIC COMPOSITIONS;TRACE-ELEMENTS;HEAVY-METALS;SOIL LEAD;ATMOSPHERIC-POLLUTION;EXTRACTION TECHNIQUES;HEALTH IMPACTS;DRINKING-WATER,,

Result suggests that although wastewater treatment resulted in higher than 1.06 log Escherichia coli (E. coli) reduction at all WWTPs, yet the percent of E. coli resistant to most of the antibiotics increased from influent to effluent. Higher prevalence of ARB, ARG, and MDR were noted in hospital WWTP owing to the higher antibiotic concentrations used and excreted by the patients. With reference to India, the WWTPs in Sri Lanka showed more ARB and a consistent increase in its percentages after the treatment but were less resistant to Fluoroquinolone (FQ). E. coli strains isolated from each location of both countries showed multidrug resistance, which has increased after the treatment and was strongly correlated with FQ in every WWTP. Resistant genes for Fluoroquinolone (FQ) (aac(6')-1b-cr, qnrB, qnrS), beta-lactams (ampC), and sulphonamides (sul1) were common in all the wastewaters except additional parC gene in the hospital effluent of Sri Lanka, implying much higher resistance for quinolones, especially for Ciprofloxacin.

Soil HM pollution showed great spatial variations cross the regions and countries. Accumulations of As, Cu, Pb, and Zn in the YSK were significantly higher than those in the BS and YSC (p < 0.05). Whilst the elevated Cd, Hg, and Ni in soils were found in the BS and YSC compared to those in the YSK (p < 0.05). Meantime, the assessment of ecological risk posed by HMs indicated higher potential risk in the BS than other coastal areas. In specific, Cd and Hg posed a higher risk in the BS and YSC, while As showed relatively high risk in the YSK, indicating site-dependent accumulation of HMs in soils. Soil pH and organic matter were found to be important factors affecting the HM accumulation in the study areas. Industrial activities are the major driving factors influencing spatial distributions of HMs, and such activities exhibited different degrees of influence across the sampling sites. Altogether, the results of present study first identified the bilateral characteristics of soil HM pollution along the entire coasts of the YSLME in a comprehensive manner in several aspects: (1) sources, (2) hot spots, (3) priority chemicals of concern, and (4) site-specific potential risk of the soil HMs. Overall, this study provides references and backgrounds for future environmental management strategies and aids in developing a bilateral government policy towards coastal pollution management of HMs from an international scale and perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"YANGTZE-RIVER ESTUARY;HUMAN HEALTH-RISK;SOURCE IDENTIFICATION;SURFACE        SEDIMENTS;AGRICULTURAL SOILS;CONTAMINATION ASSESSMENT;NORTHERN BOHAI;URBAN SOILS;TRACE-METAL;INDUSTRIAL;Metals, Heavy;China;Korea",,

The strong dependency on the synoptic weather conditions, rather than on city-specific, constant features, hinders the identification of recurrent patterns, leading conventional predicting algorithms to fail.        In this paper, an advanced artificial intelligence technique based on long short-term memory (LSTM) model is applied to gain insight and predict the highly fluctuating heat island intensity (UHII) in the city of Sydney, Australia, governed by the dualistic system of cool sea breeze from the ocean and hot western winds from the vast desert biome inlands.        Hourly measurements of temperature, collected for a period of 18 years (1999-2017) from 8 different sites in a 50 km radius from the coastline, were used to train (80%) and test (20%) the model. Other inputs included date, time, and previously computed UHII, feedbacked to the model with an optimized time step of six hours. A second set of models integrated wind speed at the reference station to account for the sea breeze effect. The R-2 ranged between 0.770 and 0.932 for the training dataset and between 0.841 and 0.924 for the testing dataset, with the best performance attained right in correspondence of the city hot spots. Unexpectedly, very little benefit (0.06-0.43%) was achieved by including the sea breeze among the input variables.        Overall, this study is insightful of a rather rare climatological case at the watershed between maritime and desertic typicality.

However, the low sensitivity, selectivity, and reproducibility in the bioanalytical SERS are the main obstacles for clinical use. Herein, we demonstrate a high sensitive and selective label-free lysozyme biomarker detection platform based on coupling of SERS with molecular imprinting technique. The hierarchical silver microspheres with dendritic structure are controllably fabricated by a wet-chemical self-assembly approach. Based on selection of surface-active regions by density functional theory (DFT) simulations, a thin MIPs film (thickness < 15 nm) is then grafted on Ag microsphere surface through surface imprinting. As a result, the final synthesized Ag@MIPs hybrid exhibits as low as 5 ng mL(-1) detection limit for target lysozyme, and high selectivity and reproducibility. Intensive ""hot spots"" in Ag@MIPs confirmed by Raman mapping give rise to the high-performance SERS. Meanwhile, DFT calculations are employed to investigate the SERS spectra and assist the assignment for the characteristic peaks of lysozyme.

However, the scope of urban commercial areas cannot be easily detected by traditional methods because of difficulties in data collection. Considering the positive correlation between business scale and nighttime lighting, this paper proposes a method of urban commercial areas detection based on nighttime lights satellite imagery. First, an imagery preprocess model is proposed to correct imageries and improve efficiency of cluster analysis. Then, an exploratory spatial data analysis and hotspots clustering method is employed to detect commercial areas by geographic distribution metric with urban commercial hotspots. Furthermore, four imageries of Wuhan City and Shenyang City are selected as an example for urban commercial areas detection experiments. Finally, a comparison is made to find out the time and space factors that affect the detection results of the commercial areas. By comparing the results with the existing map data, we are convinced that the nighttime lights satellite imagery can effectively detect the urban commercial areas. The time of image acquisition and the vegetation coverage in the area are two important factors affecting the detection effect. Harsh weather conditions and high vegetation coverage are conducive to the effective implementation of this method. This approach can be integrated with traditional methods to form a fast commercial areas detection model, which can then play a role in large-scale socio-economic surveys and dynamic detection of commercial areas evolution. Hence, a conclusion can be reached that this study provides a new method for the perception of urban socio-economic activities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,Imagery (Psychotherapy),,

In Indonesia, three persons die on road every hour. Understanding where and how road traffic crashes happen is imperative before the most efficient countermeasures can be devised and implemented. In this paper, three tools-hot spots, hot zones and hot clusters-are used to identify sections of two main highways in the Province of Aceh that require most urgent action. Many countermeasures have been developed to address the problem of black sites (hot spots). Examples of implementation often come from Australia, Europe or North America. Less research exists on countermeasures in hot zones, even less so in the Global South (less developed countries from Southeast Asia, Africa and Latin America). This research applies quantitative spatial analysis that builds on existing works using the hot zone methodology and goes a step further by suggesting relevant countermeasures. More precisely, by taking into consideration the global urban-rural divide, this paper attempts to identify the most dangerous highway sections, in Indonesia, and to suggest appropriate hot zone countermeasures based on the characteristics of these hot zones. The results showed that urban highways, when compared to rural highways, were characterized by higher crash rates and a larger number of hot zones. Formulating hot zone countermeasures in urban environments should therefore consider their associated dangerousness and environmental features. Proposed countermeasures in urban roads include a stricter monitoring of the use of helmet, seat belt and cellphone, and the development of periodic communication and awareness campaigns.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,LINK-ATTRIBUTE;FRAMEWORK;IMPACT,,

Therefore, it is important to create a method to effectively identify the urban road black spots in order to quickly and accurately ensure the safety of residents and maintain the sustainable development of a city. In this study, a GIS (geographic information system) and the Firefly Clustering Algorithm are combined. On the one hand, a GIS can accurately extract the distance between accident points through its spatial analysis function, overcoming the disadvantage of the accident data not usually including the specific location data. On the other hand, the Firefly Clustering Algorithm can be used to comprehensively extract the characteristics of accident points, which is particularly suitable for the identification of black spots. In order to verify the feasibility of the proposed method, this research compares the identification effect between the OD (origin-destination) cost distance calculated by GIS and the Euclidean distance. The results show that the Euclidean distance is smaller than the OD cost distance and that the accident search method based on the Euclidean distance can overestimate the number of black spots, especially for intersections. Therefore, the proposed method based on the Firefly Clustering Algorithm and GIS can not only contribute to identifying urban road black spots but also plays an auxiliary role in reducing urban road crashes and maintaining sustainable urban development.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Included"", ""Fagner ""=>""Included"", ""taniabatistela""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Cluster,Revisado | USER-NOTES: {""Fagner ""=>[""AUXILIAR: Summary of black spot identification methods"", "" 84\nCS 3.9""]}",,SPATIAL-ANALYSIS;ACCIDENT;Algorithms;Information Systems;African Continental Ancestry Group,,

The Indian subcontinent is one of the four global hot-spots at increased risk for emergence of zoonotic diseases. Health hazards occurring due to lack of awareness about the causes and impact of zoonosis on the public health are significant. In addition, fewer efforts are seen in One-Health programs in India. Objective: To assess the knowledge level regarding the risk of zoonoses and hygiene practices among rural female population with livestock. And also to assess the actual status of practices adopted in the small holder dairy farm. Materials and Methods: A cross-sectional study was conducted among 60 female populations in peri-urban area of Najafgarh, New Delhi. A structured questionnaire and checklist for observing practicing gaps were used for data collection; Knowledge level was calculated with the help of knowledge scores. Snowball sampling was used. The analysis was done with SPSS-(22). Descriptive statistics, one sample t-test, cross tabulation and Chi-square test were used. Results: Out of total score (28), the respondents got a maximum mean score of 11. Majority of respondents (75%) had low knowledge of specific zoonotic diseases and there was an observed gap in practice. Conclusion: 75% of the respondents had low knowledge on specific zoonotic diseases, hence importance should be given on increasing knowledge about the correct handling of the livestock especially in female population through national-programs and strengthening One-Health efforts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,Zoonoses;Cross-Sectional Studies;Cesarean Section,,

Although this calibration procedure assures total predicted crashes will be localized, still the prediction of crashes for individual locations suffers from the aggregate localization process. An alternative approach of locally calibrating the HSM predictive method is proposed to improve prediction quality at individual locations while maintaining equality of total observed and total predicted crashes.        The methodology incorporates multiple calibration factors for different components of the predictive method (SPF parameters and CMFs) rather than a single calibration factor as recommended by the HSM that only calibrates at the aggregate level. In the proposed method, the application of calibration factors expressed in both weight and power function better reflects the local conditions while still ensuring calibration at the aggregate level. The parameters are estimated through an optimization process of five different methods.        Rural two-lane, two-way roads (R2U) data was used from the states of Maryland, Illinois, and Washington. A tool named ""Roadway Safety Data Integrator (RSDI)"" was developed for data preparation. Different Goodness-of-Fit measures along with CURE plots indicated that the proposed method performed significantly better than the HSM calibration method, calibration function (that will most likely be calibration process in the HSM 2nd edition), calibrated Washington models (for the case of Washington data), and some alternative calibration methods suggested by past studies. Moreover, the results indicated that the additional parameters for CMFs could improve the prediction significantly; a previous study did not find this to be so due to data limitations, but we have improved the methodology and are not so limited. Application of the proposed approach can lead to more accurate identification of hot-spots and site-specific strategies. Considering the limitations of this study, some avenues for further research are discussed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,MULTIPLE TREATMENTS;TRANSFERABILITY;MODELS;Calibration,,

The thermodynamic model is proposed, and the contact ratio of mating surface is varied to imitate the deformed plate. Moreover, the experimental study is conducted on the clutch test bench; in order to induce the plate deformation more easily, the thermometric plate has experienced the circumferential elastic deformation before experiments. Before the elastic deformation of separate plate occurs, the surface temperature increases steadily and the friction torque increases slowly with the increase of coefficient of friction. When the temperature gradient in the circumferential direction reaches the critical value 2-3 degrees C, the elastic deformation is excited. In the process of elastic deformation, the temperature growth rate in the contact zone increases dramatically, and the friction torque rises steeply. As for the variation of friction torque after the elastic deformation, it can be divided into three categories: increase smoothly, stable and decrease gradually. Moreover, at this stage, the smaller the contact ratio is, the higher the temperature in the contact zone is, and the greater the friction torque is. Meanwhile, with the decrease of the radial length and circumferential angle in the contact zone, the radial and circumferential temperature differences of the plate expand dramatically. The conclusions can be used as a theoretical basis for evaluating the real-time status of friction components and diagnosing the clutch failure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS;FAILURE-MECHANISM;THERMAL-ANALYSIS;WET        CLUTCH;HOT-SPOTS;TEMPERATURE;BEHAVIORS;PROPAGATION;PREDICTION;BOUNDARY;Congenital Abnormalities,,

However, few have looked into the impact of bus stop location changes on the distribution of street robberies. Will newly added bus stops attract more street robberies? Will the removal of existing bus stops reduce street robberies? By assessing the change of street robberies in relation to the spatial change of bus stops of Cincinnati, OH, with the consideration of the controls from socioeconomic characteristics, point of interests (POI) and spatial heterogeneity, this study uses before-and-after comparisons and the difference-in-differences (DID) analysis in the context of quasi-experiment to answer these questions. This study assesses not only the influences of the relocation of bus stops, but also the influence on street robberies of the time elapsed from the addition or removal of bus stops. Besides the three typical variables representing the presence or absence of the intervention, before or after the intervention and the interaction of the two, we add the time from addition/removal to the DID analysis. Results suggest that, on average, adding bus stops to a new location significantly increases street robberies in the areas surrounding the stops. The longer the time from the addition of a new bus stop, the more the street robberies in its surrounding areas. Removing all bus stops from a location decreases street robberies in the areas nearby; however, this influence is not statistically significant. This suggests that the relationship between street robbery and time from removal may not be linear. There are multiple studies exploring the static relationship between the bus stop and street robbery, but none looked into their dynamic relationship. This study represents the first attempt to do so. Its findings add new evidence to the theories of rational choice, routine activity, crime pattern, and crime displacement.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,PREDICTING SPATIAL-PATTERNS;CRIME-PREVENTION;LOS-ANGELES;HOT-SPOTS;LAND-USE;TRANSIT;UNEMPLOYMENT;CRIMINOLOGY;STATIONS;UTILITY,,

Here, we first evaluate coastal HM pollution in sediment and water from 119 riverine, estuarine, and marine locations along the BS and Yellow Sea to perform a comparative assessment between the two countries of China and South Korea. The occurrence, distribution, sources, multimedia fate, interactions, associated environmental factors, and potential ecological risks relating to the HM pollution are widely addressed. Eight typical HMs (As, Hg, Zn, Cu, Pb, Cd, Cr, and Ni) were targeted in both sediments and water, and in situ water properties (pH, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and temperature) and sediment properties (pH and organic matter (OM) content) were analyzed. The results indicated that As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Ni, and Pb concentrations in water were higher in the estuarine area than those in riverine and marine areas and that particularly severe HM pollution was evidenced in the BS. The dominant elements in pollution hot spots varied greatly among the countries and regions. According to the geo-accumulation index (I-geo) and pollution load index (PLI) values, the sediments exhibited high Hg and Pb pollution in the BS; high As, Hg, and Pb pollution in the Yellow Sea of China; and high Cd and Hg pollution in the Yellow Sea of South Korea. In general, the sediments were moderately contaminated by HMs based on the high PLI (> 1.0) and risk index (RI) values (> 160). Ni and Cr in the sediment mainly originated from geogenic sources, while the other elements (Zn, As, Cd, Cu, Hg, and Pb) were primarily linked to anthropogenic sources. Based on the partial redundancy analysis, we found that environmental factors, especially OM, contributed significantly to the concentrations of HMs in both the sediments and water. The sediment HMs significantly contributed to the waterborne HMs due to their release from the sediments to the water column. An overall assessment of the contamination status, spatial distribution, and potential sources of HMs suggested that the water-sediment interaction of HMs and the influence by environmental factors should be subsequently considered for a better understanding of the multimedia fate of HMs in the given dynamic YSLME system or similar environments elsewhere.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"SURFACE SEDIMENTS;SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;RIVER ESTUARY;TRACE-METALS;SOURCE IDENTIFICATION;CHINA DISTRIBUTION;GREENHOUSE SOILS;NORTHERN        BOHAI;HAIHE RIVER;CONTAMINATION;Metals, Heavy;Risk Assessment",,

Street segments with higher levels of social and physical disorder, along with lower levels of collective efficacy, are expected to have higher rates of firearm shooting events when accounting for neighborhood-level measures.

The analysis also indicated that the number of effective infections decreased in Nigeria after the introduction of free antiretroviral treatment in 2006. Finally, Bayesian phylogeographic analysis suggested gravity-like dynamics in which virus lineages first emerge and expand within large urban centers such as Abuja and Lagos, before migrating towards smaller rural areas.

Selective heating by microwave produce the more polar regions, which results in swelling and fragmentation of raw materials near the hot spots. Therefore, ionic liquid-microwave-assisted extraction method of free-state biphenyl cyclooctene lignans was set up.

The IL solutions with different mole fractions of IL were detected by FTIR and Raman spectroscopy, the result shows that IL solutions with higher water contents (> 0.6) won't form clusters. The optimum hydrolysis conditions were 0.2 g of ionic liquid catalyst per 5.0 g of S. chinensis fruits, a microwave irradiation power of 600 W, and heating time of 12 min, which gave a yield of free-state biphenyl cyclooctene lignans of 4.12 +/- 0.37 mg g(-1).

A two-step spatio-temporal clustering analysis is employed for identifying localized hot spots in space and time and for refining detected hot spots, based on the nature of bus bunching events. First, the Spatio-Temporal Density Based Scanning Algorithm with Noise (ST-DBSCAN) is applied to distinguish bunching patterns at the network level and subsequently a k++means algorithm is employed to distinguish different types of bunching clusters. Results offer insights on specific time periods and route segments, where bus bunching events are more likely to occur and, also, on how bus bunching clusters change over time. Further, headway deviation analysis reveals the differences in the characteristics of the various bunching event types per line, showing that routes running on shared corridors experience more issues while underlying causes may vary per line. Collectively, results can help guide practice toward more flexible solutions and control strategies. Indeed, depending on the type of spatio-temporal patterns detected, appropriate improvements in service planning and real-time control strategies may be identified in order to mitigate their negative effects and improve quality of service. In light of emerging electric public transport systems, the proposed framework can be also used to determine preventive strategies and improve reliability in affected stops prior to the deployment of charging infrastructure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,VEHICLE LOCATION DATA;SERVICE RELIABILITY;TRANSIT OPERATIONS;TIME-ESTIMATION;TRAVEL-TIME;MODEL;VARIABILITY;ALGORITHM;FRAMEWORK;QUALITY,,

With the increasing impacts of urban expansion eminent, policymakers have encouraged researchers to advance or invent methods for managing coupled human-environmental systems associated with local and regional sustainable development planning. Although progress has been made, there remains no universal instrument for attaining sustainability on neither regional nor local planning scales. Previous sustainable urbanization studies have revealed that landscape configuration metrics can supplement other measures of urban well-being, yet few have been included in public data dashboards or contrasted against local well-being indicators. To advance this sector of sustainable development planning, this study had three main intentions: (1) to produce a foundational suite of landscape ecology metrics from the 2007 land cover dataset for the City of Toronto; (2) to visualize and interpret spatial patterns of neighborhood streetscapepatch cohesion index (COHESION), Shannon's diversity index (SHDI), and four Wellbeing Toronto indicators across the 140 Toronto neighborhoods; (3) to quantitatively assess the global collinearity and local explanatory power of the well-being and landscape measures showcased in this study. One-hundred-and-thirty landscape ecology metrics were computed: 18 class configuration metrics across seven land cover categories and four landscape diversity metrics. Anselin Moran's I-test was used to illustrate significant spatial patterns of well-being and landscape indicators; Pearson's correlation and conditional autoregressive (CAR) statistics were used to evaluate relationships between them.

The planning approach created a mobile application for data collection by gram sevaks at the village level. It employed ranking methods developed with district officers to prioritize villages with the greatest needs, cluster analysis to distinguish different types of needs, and geographic information system (GIS) mapping to visualize the spatial distribution of those needs. This analysis shows that there are high levels of spatial heterogeneity in water services within, as well as between, blocks but also that there are broad patterns of priorities for planning and policy purposes. These priorities include water service needs in the Western Ghats, a combination of water source and service needs in dissected plateau lands, source strengthening in the eastern plains, and local hot spots in peri-urban areas. Based on this Pune district case study, the Government of Maharashtra is testing the approach in five additional districts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,CLUSTER;India;Drinking,,

Remote sensing, participatory mapping and focus group discussions were used to explore the spatio-temporal changes and trade-offs in land-cover change from 1984 to 2013, and how that affects provisioning ecosystem services in the area. Communities derive a number of provisioning ecosystem services from the catchment. Forty-eight species of edible wild animals (including birds), 28 species of edible wild plants and fungi, 22 species of medicinal plants, construction materials, ornamental flowers, firewood, honey, gum, reeds and thatch/weaving grasses were derived from the catchment and used by local communities. These provisioning services are under threat from land-use change within two ""hot-spots"", Zomba Mountain and mouth of the river at Lake Chilwa. Zomba Mountain has experienced losses in forests and gains in shrublands, and Lake Chilwa area saw losses of forests, wetlands and shrublands due to increased areas under cultivation. Extrapolation of trends of land cover change in the catchment until 2023 revealed that forests and wetlands will occupy less than 2% of the catchment, while urban areas will grow to over 5% of catchment area. The main driver for land-use change is need for expansion of agricultural land for food production. Participatory mapping and focus group discussions point towards a decline in provisioning services in the catchment and spill-over effects to other catchments. This requires a holistic approach to address the drivers of land-use change for effective management of this ecosystem.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-COVER CHANGE;FOREST PRODUCTS;BIODIVERSITY;SPACE;CONSERVATION;LIVELIHOODS;CONSUMPTION;CHALLENGES;LANDSCAPE;RISK,,

In this work, the impact of urban expansion on the air pollution landscape has been assessed using the NO2 and SO2 ambient concentrations measured by passive diffusion samplers at 176 sites across the nine urban and the five peri-urban districts of Hanoi spanning an area of 921 km(2). The NO2 values ranged from 5.5 to 70 mu g m(3) with an arithmetic mean of 34.3 mu g m(3). The corresponding figures for SO2 are 1, 51, and 14.5 mu g m(3). The pollutant concentrations decrease from the city center outward, reflecting the history of urban expansion with the city fringe being urbanized in the 1980s and the peri-urban area having undergone development from the early 1990s. The pollution landscapes show elevated concentration levels in the recently built-up areas at 6, 10, and 21 km from the city center. The NO2 and SO2 digital maps generated from monitoring data by the kriging technique show numerous traffic and industrial emission hot spots in the peri-urban area. As revealed by the land use regression models, the factors driving the spatial variations of pollutant concentrations across the city include the population density, the road density, and the distances of the monitoring site to the urban center and the nearest roadway.

To test the applicability of user-generated content for destination management, this paper analyses restaurant reviews from five Flemish art cities which were retrieved from the Web 2.0 platform TripAdvisor. Getis-Ord hot spot analysis revealed spatial clusters of frequently ('hot spots') and rarely ('cold spots') reviewed restaurants in four out of the five art cities. By comparing these spatial patterns, the digital footprints of tourists were uncovered and discussed with DMO directors. Found patterns appeared to reflect local policies aimed either at concentrating tourism, as in Bruges, the city with the most prominent hot spot, or spreading tourism over time and space as seen in Antwerp and Ghent where less prominent hot spots were present.

It has been observed that unprecedented urbanization is primarily responsible for abrupt changes in the land system of cities.Such abrupt changes may lead to fragmentation of urban landscape and its neighbourhood areas. Generally, fragmentation begins with point locations and may convert into line- and polygon-based fragmentations. This is necessary to understand that fragmentation has negative consequences on the habitat suitability and ecosystem of a city. Consequently, this may also affect the environment in the context of sustainability. Hence, the present work proposes a framework to identify the possible hot spots of point-based fragmentation. This may help in containing landscape fragmentation. It begins with identification of zones which are more vulnerable to fragmentation using Markov chain analysis. Next, the zone-based vulnerability analysis has been downscaled to point-based fragmentation using block statistics-based spatial overlay operation. Results of the proposed framework have been validated through field survey. It has been found that landscape is fragmenting in the identified hot spots by the proposed framework. Effective measures for containing point-based fragmentation in these places may be adopted to avoid the conversion of point-based fragmentation into either line-based or polygon-based fragmentation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LANDSCAPE FRAGMENTATION;CONSERVATION;HABITAT;MODEL;India;Markov Chains,,

This finding is so consistent that David Weisburd refers to this as the ""law of crime concentration at place"". However, most research on crime concentration has been conducted in the US or European cities and has used secondary data sources. In this study, we examine whether the law of crime concentration applies in the context of sub-Saharan Africa using primary data. Methods A crime victimization survey was used to collect data in the city of Kaduna (Nigeria). Using these data, the concentration of crime (breaking-and-entering and domestic theft) was examined at the household, street segment, and neighborhood levels. Specifically, variants of a Lorenz curve and the Gini index (GI) were used to examine whether crime concentrates at these different spatial scales and if such concentration reflects anything beyond the spatial distribution of opportunity for these types of offenses. Results Crime was found to concentrate at all spatial scales, and having accounted for expectation, given the distribution of opportunity, crime was most concentrated at the household level, closely followed by street segments. It was relatively less concentrated at the neighborhood level. Conclusion The current study extends previous research in a number of ways. It shows that the law of crime concentration at place applies in a very different context to most previous work. Unlike previous studies, we use primary data collected specifically to test the law, avoiding problems associated with the dark figure of crime.

Our main conclusions are as follows: (1) In terms of network structure, the scientific cooperation network of Chinese scientists has a multi-triangular skeleton, with Beijing as its apex. The network has an obvious hierarchical structure. Beijing and Shanghai are located in the core area, and 16 cities are located in the semi-periphery of the network, while other cities are located at the periphery of the network.

Based on the reported data of varicella cases from 1 January 2014 to 31 December 2018 in Chongqing, hot spots and space-time clusters of varicella were identified using spatial autocorrelation analysis and scan statistics. Within this period, a total of 112,273 varicella cases were reported in Chongqing (average annual incidence: 73.44 per 100,000), including one death. The incidence of varicella showed an increasing trend with significant seasonal peaks, which occurred during April to July and October to January of the following year. The total ratio of male to female patients affected was 1.10:1. Children under the age of 15 and students accounted for the majority of the patient population. The hotspots detected through local spatial autocorrelation analysis, and the most likely clusters identified by scan analysis, were primarily in the main urban districts of Chongqing. The secondary clusters were mostly detected in northeast and southwest Chongqing.

(2) Various categories of retail outlets display dissimilar agglomeration characteristics and hot spots. Specialty stores, clothing and footwear stores, convenience stores, and home-building material markets have lower average nearest-neighbor distances. (3) The retail outlets in the subject area are directionally distributed in the northwest-southeast direction, which is the result of both the topographical condition and government intervention in Urumqi. (4) Various categories of retail outlets tend to agglomerate at different scales. These results are conducive to the exploration of the location rules and layout preferences of retail locations, and they provide a reference for guiding the adjustment and optimization of retail layouts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Turismo",,STREET CENTRALITY;LOCATION;STORES;PATTERN;FACILITIES,,

Our ability to manage water resources lies in accurately modeling water availability at scales meaningful to management. Although hydrologic models have been used to understand the implications of future climate and land cover change on regional water availability, many modeling approaches fail to integrate human infrastructures (HI) with bio-geophysical drivers to facilitate sustainable regional water resource management. This paper presents an integrated framework, inclusive of modeling and data needs, to quantify the effects of both bio-geophysical and HI influence on regional surface water hydrology. The framework enables the integration of high spatial and temporal anthropogenic alterations of water availability for identifying hot-spots and hot-moments of hydrological stresses within individual river-segments using a hydrologic simulation model, Soil and Water Analysis Tool (SWAT).        A high-resolution river network for the study region with a greater spatial granularity compared to contemporary SWAT applications attempted to account for HI.        The anthropogenic influence on water balance for each river segment was estimated using data on human infrastructures, such as water intakes, power production facilities, discharges, dams, and land transformation.

Analyzing the variation trend of taxi operation efficiency indicators throughout the day, mining high-income orders hot-spots and high-income regions at different periods, will effectively improve the average hourly incomes (AHI) of drivers. This paper selects the order data for each day of holidays, working days, and non-working days through the taxi order dataset of October 2019 in Xi'an. Firstly, we analyze the variation trend of taxi operation efficiency indicators in the three days. We next divide the orders into four income levels based on the Natural Breaks accordingly. Then, we use Tyson polygon and mash map matching methods to visualize the high-income orders hot-spots and high-income regions. It is significantly to analyze and summarize the visualization results. Finally, we compute the Moran'I index to measure the spatial correlation between high-income orders regions and high-income regions. The results show that (1) the number and the spatial distribution of high-income orders hot-spots and high-income regions at different periods are different. (2) Some places are hot-spots, but neither high-income orders hot-spots nor high-income regions.

Therefore, it is of massive significance to study the hot spots of urban residents' activities and enforce effective planning and decision-making for urban and traffic departments. In this paper, the data is preprocessed in the first place. Then, the passengers' pick-up points and travel track points are extracted, and the statistical analysis method is employed to analyze the travel length and travel time of urban residents. Finally, an improved FCM algorithm is proposed. The conventional Fuzzy c-means (FCM) clustering algorithm is classed as a local optimal algorithm, and the number of clustering is made uncertain. In view of the shortcomings as mentioned above, an improved (FCM) clustering algorithm is suggested in this paper, which adopts adaptive distance norm and adds its own norm induction matrix to each cluster in order to ensure global optimization. The partition coefficient (PC), classification entropy (CE) and (XB) index are introduced to assist in determining the optimal number of clustering. According to the statistical analysis of GPS track data, the morning peak and evening peak in a day is 7:00-10:00 and 17:00-20:00, respectively. Cluster analysis is carried out for each time period and the whole day using the model proposed in this paper. The results show that the number of hot spots in each time period and the whole day is 12, 10, 8, 13, 13, respectively. The hot spots are distributed in the business center, office and residential areas, which are consistent with the actual situation. It shows that the model proposed in this paper can effectively and accurately mine the hot spots of urban residents' activities. It plays an important role in urban planning and commercial layout.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS,Interessante | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,MAP-MATCHING ALGORITHMS;FCM,,

However, most spatial hotspot identification methods are univariate, analyse a single crime type, and do not consider if hotspots are shared amongst multiple crime types. This study applies a Bayesian spatial shared component model to identify crime-general and crime-specific hotspots for violent crime and property crime at the small-area scale. The spatial shared component model jointly analyzes both violent crime and property crime and separates the area-specific risks of each crime type into one shared component, which captures the underlying crime-general spatial pattern common to both crime types, and one type-specific component, which captures the crime-specific spatial pattern that diverges from the shared pattern. Crime-general and crime-specific hotspots are classified based on the posterior probability estimates of the shared and type-specific components, respectively. Results show that the crime-general pattern explains approximately 81% of the total variation of violent crime and 70% of the total variation of property crime. Crime-general hotspots are found to be more frequent than crime-specific hotspots, and property crime-specific hotspots are more frequent than violent crime-specific hotspots. Crime-general and crime-specific hotspots are areas that may be targeted with comprehensive initiatives designed for multiple crime types or specialized initiatives designed for a single crime type, respectively.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,SOCIAL-DISORGANIZATION;VIOLENT CRIME;COLOCATION QUOTIENT;ROUTINE        ACTIVITIES;HOT-SPOTS;PATTERNS;NEIGHBORHOODS;ASSOCIATION;JOINT;RISK;Crime,,

There are many productions and applications in path planning and navigation, however due to the complexity of urban road networks, the difficulty of the traffic prediction increases. The optimal path means not only the shortest distance in geography, but also the shortest time, the lowest cost, the maximum road capacity, etc. In fast-paced modern cities, people tend to reach the destination with the shortest time. The corresponding paths are considered as the optimal paths. However, due to the high data sensing speed of GPS devices, it is different to collect or describe real traffic flows. To address this problem, we propose an innovative path planning method in this paper. Specially, we first introduce a crossroad link analysis algorithm to calculate the real-time traffic conditions of crossroads (i.e. the values). Then, we adopt a value based for the path planning by considering the real-time traffic conditions. To avoid the high volume update of values, a structure is proposed to dynamically update local values from the multi-level subareas. In the optimization process, to achieve desired navigation results, we establish the traffic congestion coefficient to reflect different traffic congestion conditions. To verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, we use the actual traffic data of Beijing. The experimental results show that our method is able to generate the appropriate path plan in the peak and low dynamic traffic conditions as compared to online applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,NEURAL-NETWORK;ROBOT NAVIGATION;ALGORITHM;SYSTEM,,

Methods: Data necessary for the study were extracted from databases of traffic police, statistics center, ministry of roads and urban development, and Iran meteorological organization. Hot spots analysis was used based on Getis-Ord G statistics in geographically weighted regression models. Goodness of fit of models was evaluated using the Bayesian information criterion, Akaike's information criterion and Deviance statistics. Results: In this study, 49,409 incidents were investigated. Of these, 48,382 (98%) cases were injuries and 1027 (2%) cases were fatal accidents. The incidence of fatal accidents does not follow a specific pattern; however, the incidence of accidents leading to injuries is higher in the central and the northeastern provinces of the country and lower in the southern and southeast provinces of the country. The final models showed that the relationship between different variables, including demographic characteristics, road network, and distance from the capital, traffic volume, and rainfall with dependent variables (number of accidents in geographic units), was statistically significant. Conclusion: In order to better design preventive plans for traffic accidents and promote the safety of passageways for pedestrians inside and outside the cities, these factors need to be considered more carefully, and practical solutions should be developed and implemented for their correction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Específico",,"MOTOR-VEHICLE COLLISIONS;SEVERITY LEVELS;CRASHES;IMPACT;Accidents, Traffic;Iran",,

Comparing plant communities in habitats with different degrees of urbanization may provide valuable information for the management and restoration of these vulnerable habitats. In this study, we explored the impact of urbanization on vegetation communities between artificial and semi-natural habitats within two rivers with different levels of development. We compared species richness, types of vegetation, and composition patterns of the plants in our study. In artificial habitats, the sites with relatively high levels of urbanization had the highest species richness, while in semi-natural habitats, the highest species richness was recorded in the less urbanized sites. Furthermore, every component of urbanization that contributed to the variation of species richness was examined in the current study. In artificial habitats, the proportion of impervious surface was the strongest predictor of the variation in species richness and was associated with the richness of alien, native, and riparian species. In semi-natural habitats, most of the richness of alien and native species were associated with the distance to the city center, and the number of riparian and ruderal species was significantly related to the proportion of impervious surface. Moreover, we found that a high level of urbanization was always associated with a large abundance of alien and ruderal species in both artificial and in semi-natural habitats. We recommend the methods of pair comparison of multiple rivers to analyze the impact of urbanization on plant species in riparian areas and have suggested various management actions for maintaining biodiversity and sustainability in riparian ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SPECIES-DIVERSITY;BIOLOGICAL INVASIONS;IMPACTS;BIODIVERSITY;DISTURBANCE;LANDSCAPE;PATTERNS;FLORA;HOMOGENIZATION;FRAGMENTATION,,

The main objective of this study was to depict the spatiotemporal epidemiological characteristics of the incidence of scarlet fever in Shenyang, China, in 2018 so as to provide the scientific basis for effective strategies of scarlet control and prevention. Methods Excel 2010 was used to demonstrate the temporal distribution at the month level and ArcGIS10.3 was used to demonstrate the spatial distribution at the district/county level. Moran's autocorrelation coefficient was used to examine the spatial autocorrelation and the Getis-Ord statistic was used to determine the hot-spot areas of scarlet fever. Results A total of 2314 scarlet fever cases were reported in Shenyang in 2018 with an annual incidence of 31.24 per 100,000. The incidence among males was higher than that among females(p<0.001). A vast majority of the cases (96.89%) were among children aged 3 to 11 years. The highest incidence was 625.34/100,000 in children aged 5-9 years. In 2018 there were two seasonal peaks of scarlet fever in June (summer-peak) and December (winter-peak). The incidence of scarlet fever in urban areas was significantly higher than that in rural areas(p<0.001). The incidence of scarlet fever was randomly distributed in Shenyang. There are hotspot areas located in seven districts. Conclusions Urban areas are the hot spots of scarlet fever and joint prevention and control measures between districts should be applied. Children aged 3-11 are the main source of scarlet fever and therefore the introduction of prevention and control into kindergarten and primary schools may be key to the control of scarlet fever epidemics.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicatas",,ENGLAND;GIS;China;Q Fever;Fever;Epidemiologic Studies,,

These sources are located mainly in the urban and industrial areas of Ho Chi Minh City (HCMC) and Dong Nai province. The statistical analysis of monitoring data allows us to determine the state of water quality while the modelling approach provides the means to manage the pollution sources. Both approaches are used in this work. Our statistical analysis of the water quality data collected at many stations from the upper reach of the Saigon and Dong Nai rivers to the urban waterways and the lower end of the rivers near the sea shows a contrast of water quality in different basin areas. These differences are consistent in both dry and rainy seasons and during the high tide and low tide. The results show that several hot spots of some water quality variables require management focus, such as organic waste water pollution at Binh Dien and Thay Cai in HCMC mainly due to local sources. Moderately and highly degraded water quality occurs at Binh Phuoc, Phu An and Cat Lai which are downstream from the industrial areas of Binh Duong (Binh Duong province) and Bien Hoa (Dong Nai province) before entering HCMC. Modelling of some important water quality variables also confirms the spatial extent of the areas where water quality is different as analysed from the statistical analysis of monitoring data.

Point Density (PD) method was used to verify hot spots in urban region that resulted from the mentioned two methods. Traffic accidents' hot spots were predicted for Irbid City in Jordan using the data of the accidents that occurred between 2013 and 2015. Both WOM and FOM proved to be successful in identifying hot spots in parts of study area when verified to PD surface. Final results showed that eight hot spots were pointed out; three are road sections and five are major intersections, which were analyzed to get accident-contributing factors and suggest the proper remedies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Included"", ""Fagner ""=>""Included""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Fuzzy,Revisado,HOT-SPOTS,FuzzyClustering | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicatas | USER-NOTES: {""Fagner ""=>[""P 79\nCS 3.4""]}",,"IDENTIFICATION;Accidents, Traffic;Fuzzy Logic",,

Four nested subwatersheds in Southern Ontario, Canada (one natural woodlot, two agricultural and one mixed agricultural and urban) were monitored over one year to identify peak periods ('hot moments') and areas ('hot spots') of nutrient (dissolved reactive phosphorus, DRP; total phosphorus, TP; and nitrate, NOT) export and discharge. Annual nutrient export was small at the natural site (0.001 kg DRP ha(-1); 0.004 kg TP ha(-1); 0.04 kg NO3-N ha(-1)) compared to the agricultural and mixed-use sites (0.10-0.15 kg DRP ha(-1); 0.70-0.94 kg TP ha(-1); 9.15-11.55 kg NO3-N ha(-1)). Temporal patterns in P concentrations were similar throughout the sites, where spring was the dominant season for P export, irrespective of land use. Within the Hopewell Creek watershed, P and N hot spots existed that were consistently hot spots across all events with the location of these hot spots driven by local land use patterns, where there was elevated P export from a dairy-dominated sub-watershed and elevated N export from both of the two agricultural subwatersheds. These estimates of seasonal- and event-based nutrient loads and discharge across nested sub-watersheds contribute to the growing body of evidence demonstrating the importance of identifying critical areas and periods in which to emphasize management efforts.

Traffic zone could be generated by different division approaches (e.g., rule-based approaches, data-driven approaches), which may lead to different diverse division results and characteristics. The traditional division approaches usually rely on human experience or static constraints (e.g., political boundaries or natural environment) while neglecting the traveling pattern among different regions. Data-driven approaches are also utilized in recent years; however, domain knowledge and rules are not well integrated and represented in such systems. This paper proposes a new approach that both combines patterns that is hidden in the data and user-defined rules. It not only fully employs the traffic hot spots and traveling patterns among different regions, but also considers the realistic constraints such as road network. We also design TZVis, a visual analysis system that fully integrates with the division approach. The system allows users to generate multiple traffic zone division schemes under different requirements, analyze the schemes in multiple views and select an optimal traffic zone scheme. It provides a map overview to show the traffic zone division result, a matrix view to show the traffic relationship of zones, a parallel coordinates plot for displaying the specific traffic records, a LineUp view to display all the division results and a radar chart to show the features of each zones.

It would thus be helpful if the extent and spatial pattern of future land abandonment could be projected. However, the trajectory of future land abandonment generally depends on various factors, including biophysical conditions and future changes in socioeconomic indicators in the area. In this study, we developed a general framework for a scenario-based land abandonment projection, featuring a coupled regional economic and spatially explicit land change modeling approach. We applied this framework in selected municipalities in Fukushima Prefecture, Japan, under two socioeconomic development scenarios (2014-2050): low population and economic growth (LL scenario) and high population and economic growth (HH scenario). The case study results, which are also visualized through a set of hot spot maps, revealed that agricultural land abandonment would be more intense under the HH scenario due to the much higher future decline in farmer population driven by the shift in people's employment and main source of livelihood. Under the LL scenario, residential and urban land abandonment would be more profound because of the much higher future decline in total population. In general, our results provide insights into some plausible future socioeconomic changes, their interplay and their consequent land abandonment in the case study Scenario analysis area, which would be useful in the context of forward-looking adaptive development planning. The pro- posed framework can be applied to other case study areas. (C) 2019 Elsevier B.V.

Here, we investigated the patterns and drivers of benthic bacterial alpha- and beta-diversity (i.e., OTU richness and turnover diversity) along the vertical profile down to 1.5 m sediment depth in the Izu-Bonin Trench (at similar to 10,000 m water depth). The protease and glucosidase enzymatic activity rates were also determined, as a proxy of organic matter degradation potential in the different sediment layers. Molecular fingerprinting based on automated ribosomal intergenic spacer analysis (ARISA) indicated that the alpha-diversity of bacterial assemblages remained high throughout the vertical profile and that the turnover (beta-) diversity among sediment horizons reached values up to 90% of dissimilarity. Multivariate distance-based linear modeling (DISTLM) pointed out that the diversity and functioning of the hadal bacterial assemblages were influenced by the variability of environmental conditions (including the availability of organic resources and electron donors/acceptors) and of viral production rates along the sediment vertical profile. Based on our results, we can argue that the heterogeneity of physical-chemical features of the hadal sediments of the Izu-Bonin Trench contribute to increase the niches availability for different bacterial taxa, while viruses contribute to maintain high levels of bacterial turnover diversity and to enhance organic matter cycling in these extremely remote and isolated ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,IZU-OGASAWARA TRENCH;BENTHIC CARBON MINERALIZATION;FRAGMENT-LENGTH-POLYMORPHISM;DEEP-SEA;MICROBIAL DIVERSITY;ORGANIC-MATTER;SURFACE SEDIMENTS;MARINE VIRUSES;WATER COLUMN;COMMUNITY,,

People usually travel by foot through safe routes and urban spaces in the built environment as they are perceived as safe areas, such as: lighted paths, walking on the livable side of a sidewalk instead of walking beside a sealed facade, or away from unsecured building entrances. The way people use and interact in their built environment involves their cognitive perception, which depends upon the urban fabric details. Therefore, planners and decision makers aimed in understanding the way the components of the built environment affect unsecured environments so as to assess the risks before design decisions are made. However, they lack new approaches and models with which to evaluate a qualitative sense of security that is understandable on a human-scale in the built environment. This research deals with this gap in information and measures one unmeasurable qualitative aspect of the built environment, the sense of security, in quantitative terms based on a geo-spatial system, and then relate it to human-scale urban form. The Security Rating Index (SRI) establishes a GIS-based, quantifiable system to identify and rate insecure urban spaces to be used by urban planners and city decision makers to evaluate and improve urban resilience. The system is based on measurements of urban elements that influence the sense of security in the built environment, and can be used to identify characteristics and hot spots of unsecured spaces in a city.

Varying levels were observed between background site subtypes, with concentrations at urban background sites (located near the center of Athens and the port of Piraeus) being 34% and 114% higher, on average, than at suburban and regional background sites, respectively. The traffic intensity at the nearest road and the population and built density in the surrounding area of sites were recognized as important factors controlling BC levels. On-road concentration measurements (5.4 mu g m(-3) on average) enabled the identification of hot-spots in the road network, with peak levels encountered along motorways (13.5 mu g m(-3) on average).

Then the interpretation ability of a single landscape and a combination of landscapes to explain surface temperature was explored using the Pearson correlation coefficient and ordinary least squares regression from different spatial levels, and the spatial heterogeneity of the interpretation ability was explored using geographical weighted regression under the optimal granularity (5 x 5 km). The results showed that: (1) The hot spots of surface temperature were distributed mainly in the plains and on the southeast hills, where the landscapes primarily include artificial landscape (ArtLS) and farmland landscape (FarmLS). The cold spots were distributed mainly in the northern hills, which are dominated by forest landscape (ForLS). (2) On the whole, the interpretative ability of ForLS, FarmLS, ArtLS, green space landscape pattern, and ecological landscape pattern to explain surface temperature was stronger, whereas the interpretative ability of grassland landscape and wetland landscape to explain surface temperature was weaker. The interpretation ability of landscape pattern to explain surface temperature was obviously different in different areas. Specifically, the ability was stronger in the hills than in the plain and plateau. The results are intended to provide a scientific basis for adjusting landscape structural, optimizing landscape patterns, alleviating the UHI effect, and coordinating the balance among cities within the urban agglomeration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE;HEAT-ISLAND;IMPACTS;URBANIZATION;RIVER;AREA;EXPANSION;SHANGHAI;DYNAMICS;METRICS,,

The selection of the research area was justified by the fact that Poland is the largest and significantly spatially differentiated transition economy in Central-Eastern Europe, recognised as a substantial beneficiary of EU accession in 2004. The time range of analysis was set as the result of a comparison of data availability in Corine Land Cover (CLC) and Statistics Poland. The CLC dataset referring to land cover and land use changes between 2012 and 2018 was used. The focus on modifications taking place within one of the main land cover groups at level 3 of detail was applied in this research. These changes were analysed as percentages referring to the area of the municipality and to the total area of changes in the investigated period. Two categories of EU grants were considered: total and infrastructural (granted under EU Operational Programme ""Infrastructure and Environment""). Moreover, some control economic, social, demographic, institutional, infrastructural, and environmental variables were applied to better explain land cover changes. Moran's local statistic was employed to detect spatial hot-spots of EU grants absorption, as well as hot-spots of land cover changes. Then, a collection of various variables related to determinants of land cover changes was set. Economic factors, including EU grants absorption, as well as factors related to accessibility, agrarian structure, demography, environment, and spatial planning were investigated. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was employed to convert the set of all considered variables into a set of few uncorrelated predictors. Finally, Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) was applied to describe the spatially varied impact of investigated determinants, including EU grants, represented by estimated principal components on land cover changes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"SPATIALLY VARYING RELATIONSHIPS;SCALE-DEPENDENT RELATIONSHIPS;STRUCTURAL FUNDS;EUROPEAN-UNION;AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE;REGIONAL        CONVERGENCE;URBAN SPRAWL;DETERMINANTS;URBANIZATION;REGRESSION;Poland;Absorption;Financing, Organized",,

In recent years, to mitigate this the design and construction of new buildings has emphasized ""smart"" methods and materials for individual buildings rather than landscape-level planning and evaluation of new developments. Remote Sensing potentially offers a cost-effective means to monitor effectiveness of landscape-level urban design and guide developers to improve thermal regimes. This paper focuses on satellite monitoring of thermal variation in the area of London most affected by construction in 2010-2015. Split-window Land Surface Temperature (LST) models were applied to ASTER and Landsat 8 satellite imagery, requiring separate investigation of thermal trends due to temporal inconsistency. Getis-Ord-Gi* cluster analysis of the ASTER image identified three main thermal hot spots: Eastern, Stratford railway/underground station, and Stratford High Street. It is assumed that increased thermal stress within these areas is mainly from anthropogenic heat. However, local thermal variations for Eastern Olympic Village are attributed to changing meteorological conditions, facade materials, canyon morphology and orientation, or insufficient shading and ventilation. Future development of a new cultural hub at this location will significantly affect distribution of green spaces and influence their cooling ability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-SURFACE-TEMPERATURE;SPLIT WINDOW ALGORITHM;HEAT-ISLAND;AIR-TEMPERATURE;EMISSIVITY;DERIVATION;CLIMATE;IMPACT;TM,,

Previous studies have generally focused on stemflow volume, efficiency and influential factors but have failed to depict stemflow processes and quantify their relations with rainfall characteristics within events, particularly for xerophytic shrubs. Here, we measured the stemflow volume, intensity, funneling ratio and time lags to rain at two dominant shrub species (Caragana korshinskii and Salix psammophila) and rainfall characteristics during 54 events at the semiarid Liudaogou catchment of the Loess Plateau, China, during the 2014-2015 rainy seasons. The funneling ratio was calculated as the ratio between stemflow and rainfall intensities at the inter- and intra-event scales. Our results indicated that the stemflow of C. korshinskii and S. psammophila, on average, started at 66.2 and 54.8 min, maximized 109.4 and 120.5 min after rain began, and ended 20.0 and 13.5 min after rain ceased. The two shrubs had shorter stemflow duration (3.8 and 3.4 h) and significantly larger stemflow intensities (517.5 and 367 3 mmh(-1) ) than those of rain (4.7h and 4.5 mm h(-1) ). As branch size increased, both species shared the decreasing funneling ratios (97.7-163.7 and 44.2-212.0) and stemflow intensities (333.8-716.2 and 197.2-738.7 mm h(-1) ). Tested by the multiple correspondence analysis and stepwise regression, rainfall amount and duration controlled stemflow volume and duration, respectively, at the event scale by linear relations (p < 0.01). Rainfall intensity and raindrop momentum controlled stemflow intensity and time lags to rain for both species within the event by linear or power relationships (p < 0.01). Rainfall intensity was the key factor affecting stemflow process of C. korshinskii, whereas raindrop momentum had the greatest influence on stemflow process of S. psammophila. Therefore, rainfall characteristics had temporally dependent influences on corresponding stemflow variables, and the influence also depended on specific species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,INTERCEPTION LOSS;CONIFEROUS FOREST;SALIX-PSAMMOPHILA;NORTHERN CHINA;YELLOW-POPLAR;HOT-SPOTS;THROUGHFALL;SOIL;TREE;BEECH,,

In this paper, we use a multi-source data approach to assess the patterns of ESV in the PRD from 1995 to 2015. The hot/cool-spot mapping method is used to analyse the spatial differences in ESV at a 1 km scale. The results revealed the following: (a) the proportion of increase in built-up land area is 6.3% in the PRD; this change occurred mainly through the occupation of farmland and forest land. (b) The area of hot spots increased from 37% in 1995 to 41% in 2015, while the area of cool spots increased from 34.6% to 36.3%. The ESV hot spots are mainly distributed in Zhaoqing and Huizhou.

Past research has revealed that land cover composition and configuration, along with other geographical phenomena (i.e., albedo), can explain much of the spatial pattern of UHI, yet advances await. In response, this research was made to: (i) assess the spatial pattern of mean ambient night temperature across 34 streetscapes in New York City (NYC); (ii) create and differentiate global and local regression models between-natural and built streetscape characteristics- and mean ambient night temperature; and (iii) use geographically weighted regression (GWR) to assess local patterns of correlated associations. Urban canopy layer (UCL) temperatures were recorded across 34 weather stations, and landscape metrics calculated from 0.914 m land cover data with 96% accuracy. Local Getis-Ord Gi* statistic exhibited significant spatial cold and hot spots of UHI in NYC. Global inferential tests revealed that sky-view factor, photosynthesis activity, elevation, and road configuration were the strongest predictors of mean ambient night temperature. Six multiple regression models were ultimately made with GWR fitting the UHI aptly (R-2 = 65-74%). Important explanatory covariates were illustrated using local pseudo-t statistics and linked to mean ambient night temperature, supporting the importance of GWR for understanding local UHI interactions. Results also confirm that landscape configuration metrics are stronger predictors of UHI than composition measures. Streetscape design, particularly road patterns and process, requires more consideration when attempting to mitigate UHI during future sustainability planning, urban renewal projects, and research.

Most of the traditional traffic accident black spot identification only considers time and space factors, ignoring other factors. Based on the traffic accident data of Suzhou Industrial Park, this paper makes a fusion analysis of the multi-source influencing factors involved in traffic accident black spot. According to the structured association characteristics of urban traffic accident big data, a support vector machine method based on maximizing the classification interval is used to train the complex model and optimal learning of accident black spots in the study area. The accuracy of black spot identification is improved. At the same time, aiming at the rapid growth of traffic accident multi source data, a black point identification algorithm based on deep neural network is proposed. The deep neural network of relevant data category information is established to verify the model's ability to identify accident black spots.

Although significant advances have been made in the study of social vulnerability for over two decades, China's social vulnerability profiles are mainly based on administrative unit. Consequently, no detailed distribution is provided, and the capability to diagnose human risks is hindered. In this study, we established a social vulnerability index (SoVI) in 2000 and 2010 at a spatial resolution of 250 m for China's coastal zone by combining the potential exposure index (PEI) and social resilience index (SRI). The PEI with a 250 m resolution was obtained by fitting the census data and multisource remote sensing data in random forest model. The county-level SRI was evaluated through principal component analysis based on 33 socioeconomic variables. For identifying the spatiotemporal change, we used global and local Moran's I to map clusters of SoVI and its percent change in the decade. The results suggest the following: (1) Counties in the Yangtze River Delta, Pearl River Delta, and eastern Guangzhou, except several small hot spots, exhibited the most vulnerability, especially in urban areas, whereas those in Hainan and southern Liaoning presented the least vulnerability.

To date, the height and aboveground ground biomass (AGB) of the mangrove forests on Hainan Island are unknown, partly as a result of the challenges faced during extensive field sampling in mangrove habitats (intertidal mudflats inundated by periodic seawater). Therefore, this study used a low-cost UAV-LiDAR (light detection and ranging sensor mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle) system as a sampling tool and Sentinel-2 imagery as auxiliary data to estimate and map the mangrove height and AGB on Hainan Island. Hainan Island has 3697.02 hectares of mangrove forests with an average patch area of approximately 1 ha. The results show that the mangroves on whole Hainan Island have an average height of 6.99 m, a total AGB of 474,199.31 Mg and an AGB density of 128.27 Mg ha(-1). The AGB hot spots are located in Qinglan Harbor and the south of Dongzhai Harbor. The proposed height model LiDAR-S2 performed well with an R-2 of 0.67 and an RMSE (root mean square error) of 1.90 m; the proposed AGB model G similar to LiDAR similar to S2 performed better (an R-2 of 0.62 and an RMSE of 50.36 Mg ha(-1)) than the traditional AGB model G similar to S2 that directly related ground plots and Sentinel-2 data. The results also indicate that the LiDAR metrics describing the canopy's thickness and its top and bottom characteristics are the most important variables for mangrove AGB estimation. For the Sentinel-2 indices, the red-edge and shortwave infrared features, especially the red-edge 1 and shortwave infrared Band 11 features, play the most important roles in estimating mangrove AGB and height. In conclusion, this paper presents the first mangrove height and AGB maps of Hainan Island and demonstrates the feasibility of using UAV-LiDAR as a sampling tool for mangrove forests.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,OBJECT-BASED APPROACH;GROWING STOCK VOLUME;AIRBORNE LIDAR;CHLOROPHYLL        CONCENTRATION;ALLOMETRIC MODELS;SPECTRAL INDEXES;CARBON STOCK;ATTRIBUTES;SENTINEL-2;CHINA;Trees,,

This indicated that tropical mountains in East and Southeast Asia, especially the windward maritime slopes with abundant rainfall, could be hot spots of wet Hg deposition. Wet Hg deposition flux was high in summer because of elevated rainwater Hg concentrations and high rainfall. The seasonal pattern of rainwater Hg concentrations was different from that of the East Asian air pollutant export, indicating other factors, e.g., rainfall type, were also influencing rainwater Hg concentrations. A clear difference in seasonal frequency distribution of rainfall types was observed, with rain events associated with the Pacific high pressure type (PH) occurring more frequently in summer months. PH rainfall type had the highest VWM Hg concentration (13.5 ng L-1), 2.3-6.2 ng L-1 greater than those of the other rainfall types. Because of intense surface heating under summer PH conditions, precipitation systems usually form locally due to strong convection, resulting in afternoon shower.

As a result, five municipality clusters (groups) with similar bioenergy potential structure in Switzerland are identified: (1) forest wood, (2) manure, (3) mixed agriculture, (4) low potential and (5) anthropogenic bioenergy municipalities.

The present study sought to geospatially analyze morbidities among children (0-23 months of age) using five different survey datasets (1993-2014) from the Ghana Demographic and Health Survey.        Methods        Logistic regression was used to examine childhood morbidity within a place of residence. Then three spatial statistical tools were applied to analyze morbidities among children (0-23 months of age). These tools were: spatial autocorrelation (Global Moran's I)-used to examine clustering or dispersion patterns; cluster and outlier analysis (Anselin's local Moran's I)-to ascertain geographic composition of childhood morbidity clusters and outliers; and hot spot analysis (Getis-Ord G)-to identify clusters of high values (hot spots) and low values (cold spots).        Results        Children in rural areas were much burdened with the occurrence of childhood morbidity. The study revealed positive spatial autocorrelation for childhood morbidity in Ghana. Childhood morbidity (diarrhoea, ARI, anaemia, and fever) clusters were identified within districts in the country. Children in rural areas were more likely to be morbid with diarrhoea, anaemia, and fever compared to those in urban areas. Hot spot districts for diarrhoea, anaemia and fever were mainly situated in semi-arid areas and those with ARI were located both at the semiarid areas and coastal portions of Ghana.        Conclusion        Rural children are much exposed to have higher burden of a childhood morbidity compared to their urban counterparts. Most semi-arid districts in Ghana are burdened with diarrhoea, ARI, anaemia, and fever. To minimize the occurrence of childhood morbidity in Ghana, designing of more context-based interventions to target hot spots districts of these morbidities are required in order to use scarce resources judiciously.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,IRON-DEFICIENCY;GLOBAL BURDEN;MALARIA;CHILDREN;FEVER;Ghana,,

Objective To explore the spatial distribution and socioeconomic influencing factors of TB in mainland China from 2013 to 2016. Methods Spatial autocorrelation was used to explore the spatial distribution characteristics of TB at the quantitative level. Ordinary least squares (OLS) and geographically weighted regression (GWR) models were conducted to explore the association between factors and TB incidence from both global and local perspectives. Results There was a significant positive spatial autocorrelation of TB at the provincial level (P < 0.05): hot spots were mainly located in the west of Xinjiang and Tibet, and cold spots in the eastern coastal areas. Four latent factors on the socioeconomic dimension, involving the proportion of illiterate people aged 15 and over, per capita disposable income in rural areas, the number of health technicians per 1000 population and the urban population density, were associated with TB incidence. The GWR model showed that the effect of the same factor on TB incidence varied with geographical location. Conclusions Spatial clustering of TB incidence in mainland China still exists. The differences of socioeconomic factors in different locations can be confirmed by GWR model. Targeted preventive and control measures or policies will be conducive in effectively reducing the incidence of TB, especially in hot spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,DETERMINANTS;PREVALENCE;China,,

By knowing what products comprise urban consumption ""hot spots,"" municipalities and consumers alike could take deliberate actions to target and discourage consumption of high-impact products. In this paper, a new method for identifying environmental hotspots of consumption is presented. The main methodological advances are the following: i) material flow analysis of urban areas and life cycle assessment are combined: ii) a 16-year time-series of urban consumption data is used for selection of the most suitable representative products and for trend analysis; iii) representative products are selected systematically from consumption data of 1000 product types; iv) representative products are scaled up to represent consumption of the product groups; v) hotspots are identified by simultaneously evaluating six environmental impacts - acidification, climate change, eutrophication (marine and freshwater), photochemical ozone formation, and resource use; vi) for the case study, hotspots are connected to the city's profiles. The method was applied to the Swedish cities Stockholm, Gothenburg and Malmo and to Sweden in total. Electronics is a hotspot for all the studied areas and all the studied impacts and should be a prioritized product group for action. Fuel is a hotspot shared by all the areas while vehicles is a hotspot in Gothenburg. Meat is a nationwide hotspot, but not for the cities investigated. Gothenburg and Stockholm could collaborate to find effective measures for their common hotspot machinery. Thus, the method can be used to identify hotspots and find which product types could be part of national versus local programs. (C) 2019 The Authors.

Because OC and EC are closely associated with fuel combustion, it is helpful for the scientific community and policymakers assessing the efficacy of air pollution control measures to study the impact of control measures and regional transport on OC and EC levels. In this study, hourly mass concentrations of OC and EC associated with PM2.5 were semi-continuously measured from March 2013 to February 2018. The results showed that annual mean OC and EC concentrations declined from 14.0 to 7.7 mu g m(3) and from 4.0 to 2.6 mu g m(3), respectively, from March 2013 to February 2018. In combination with the data of OC and EC in previous studies, an obvious decreasing trend in OC and EC concentrations was found, which was caused by clean energy policies and effective air pollution control measures. However, no obvious change in the ratios of OC and EC to the PM2.5 mass (on average, 0.164 and 0.049, respectively) was recorded, suggesting that inorganic ions still contributed a lot to PM2.5. Based on the seasonal variations in OC and EC, it appeared that higher OC and EC concentrations were still observed in the winter months, with the exception of winter of 2017-2018. Traffic policies executed in Beijing resulted in nighttime peaks of OC and EC, caused by heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty diesel vehicles being permitted to operate from 00:00 to 06:00 (China standard time, UTC + 8, for all times throughout the paper). In addition, the fact that there was no traffic restriction in weekends led to higher concentrations on weekends compared to weekdays. Significant correlations between OC and EC were observed throughout the study period, suggesting that OC and EC originated from common emission sources, such as exhaust of vehicles and fuel combustion. OC and EC levels increased with enhanced SO2, CO, and NOx concentrations while the O-3 and OC levels were enhanced simultaneously when O-3 concentrations were higher than 50 mu g m(-3). Non-parametric wind regression analysis was performed to examine the sources of OC and EC in the Beijing area. It was found that there were distinct hot spots in the northeast wind sector at wind speeds of approximately 0-6 km h(-1), as well as diffuse signals in the southwestern wind sectors. Source areas further away from Beijing were assessed by potential source contribution function (PSCF) analysis. A high-potential source area was precisely pinpointed, which was located in the northwestern and southern areas of Beijing in 2017 instead of solely in the southern areas of Beijing in 2013. This work shows that improvement of the air quality in Beijing benefits from strict control measures; however, joint prevention and control of regional air pollution in the regions is needed for further improving the air quality. The results provide a reference for controlling air pollution caused by rapid economic development in developing countries.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL;YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA;CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION;SOURCE APPORTIONMENT;ELEMENTAL CARBON;SEASONAL-VARIATIONS;OPTICAL-PROPERTIES;BACKGROUND SITE;AMBIENT PM2.5;EMISSIONS;China;Aerosols,,

Lung-inhalable particles covering a diameter range from 20 nm to 1.0 mu m were passively released into the trachea, and the Lagrangian particle tracking approach was used to predict individual particle trajectories. Overall, regional and local deposition patterns in the central airway were analyzed in detail. A preliminary interspecies data comparison was made between present rat models and previously published human data. Results showed deposition ""hot spots"" were mainly concentrated at airway bifurcation apexes, and a gravitational effect should also be considered for inertia particles when using a rat as a laboratory animal. While for humans, this may not happen as the standing posture is completely different. Lastly, the preliminary interspecies data comparison confirms the deposition similarity in terms of deposition enhancement factors, which is a weighted deposition concentration parameter. This interspecies comparison confirms feasibility of extrapolating surrogate rat deposition data to humans using existing data extrapolation approach, which mostly relies on bulk anatomical differences as dose adjustment factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,INTRATRACHEAL INSTILLATION;DEPOSITION;POLLUTION;DOSIMETRY;MODELS;NANOPARTICLES;DISPERSION;TOXICITY;CANCER;MONKEY;Rats;Lung,,

Although there is an increasing ecological need to use continuous methods to understand spatial heterogeneity and vegetation fragmentation, they remain unexplored. Since local indicators of spatial association (LISA) can capture important spatial patterns of clustering and dispersion at a local scale, it can capture important ecological patterns and process of vegetation fragmentation. This work examines the utility of LISA which allows exploration of local patterns in spatial data in identifying high (hot spots) and low (cold spots) spatial clusters of vegetation patches and fragmentation patterns in Harare metropolitan city in Zimbabwe. The LISA indices of Getis-Ord Gi* and local Moran's I are computed both on continuous normalized difference vegetation index and discrete land cover data of vegetation and nonvegetation of Sentinel 2016 and 2018. Local spatial clustering patterns are identified with Z-score values that indicate the significance of each statistic. High positive Z-scores are located in the large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation. Negative Z-scores are located in more dispersed and highly fragmented vegetation. The results suggest that there is a strong tendency for large core, undisturbed, and homogeneous vegetation patches to be spatially clustered and for small, isolated and sparse vegetation patches to be dispersed. The highly fragmented vegetation patches are located in the heavily urbanized part of the city. Overall, findings of this study underscore the relevance of the spatially explicit method of LISA as a valuable source of spatial information for the assessment of local spatial clustering and dispersion of urban vegetation patches.

Our findings show that the inundation area of the residential buildings caused by a 1/200-year storm flood reaches 24.9 km(2), and the total loss of residential buildings and household properties is 29.7 billion CNY (Chinese Yuan) (or 4.4 billion USD), while the inundation area of residential buildings and the total loss increases up to 162.4 km(2) and 366.0 billion CNY (or 54.2 billion USD), respectively for a 1/5000-year storm flood. The estimated average annual loss (AAL) of residential buildings and household properties for Shanghai is 590 million CNY/year (or 87.4 million USD/year), with several hot spots distributed around the main urban area and on the bank of the Hangzhou Bay. Among sixteen districts, Pudong has the highest exposure and annual expected loss, while the inner city is also subject to extreme flooding with an AAL up to near half of the total. An analysis of flood risk in each of 209 subdistricts/towns finds that those most vulnerable to storm flooding are concentrated in Pudong, Jiading, Baoshan Districts and the inner city. Our work can provide meaningful information for risk-sensitive urban planning and resilience building in Shanghai. The methodology can also be used for risk analysis in other coastal cities facing the threat of storm flooding.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SEA-LEVEL RISE;LAND SUBSIDENCE;HUANGPU RIVER;MODEL;IMPACTS;CLIMATE;ESTUARY;LOSSES,,

Climatic hot spots within regions like the southern Indian state of Karnataka have caused a large volume of livelihood transition along the rural-urban continuum (Revi in Environ Urban 20(1):207-229, 2008. 10.1177/0956247808089157). Bengaluru is Karnataka's primate city, thus absorbing agrarians pushed out of unprofitable agriculture into its ever-growing informal service sector (Singh et al. in Clim Risk Manag 21(June):52-68, 2018. 10.1016/j.crm.2018.06.001). Climate-induced migration into urban centres creates intersecting forms of differential vulnerability. This vulnerability is structured by social discrimination embedded in informal economies, performed through respect, dignity, and humiliation in work encounters in relational economies (Simone in Public Cult 16(3):407-429, 2004). Mobility platforms like Uber and Ola cabs have added to work opportunities within Bengaluru's service sector by creating an alternative work opportunitythe digital labour market for taxi driving. The digital labour market set up by the mobility platforms offers migrants an alternative labour market to plug into without reliance on relational economies or incurring social debt. We find that the digital labour ecosystem attracts climate change-impacted migrants by offsetting access to work opportunities' in three key ways: (a) overcoming relational voids, (b) substituting network costs and circumventing social debts, (c) supplementing precarious agricultural work. This article uses evidence from qualitative data collected from in-depth semi-structured interviews with 113 Uber and Ola cab drivers in Bengaluru between 2015 and 2018 to explore the presence of the digital labour market as short-term adaptive strategy to create resilience against climate change-induced livelihood transitions into complex urban informal labour markets.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ADAPTATION;MIGRATION,,

We investigated the prevalence, diversity, and genomic localization of -lactamase resistance genes in wastewater from different parts of an UWTP, such as raw wastewater, wastewater from biological reactor, and treated wastewater, collected from the UWTP of Warsaw, Poland. In this study, we focused on gram-negative rods, mainly Enterobacteriaceae, and used Multiplex PCR to identify various -lactamase resistance genes (bla). Susceptibility to a number of antibiotics and genomic localization of -lactamase resistance genes were then determined using disc-diffusion and Southern hybridization methods, respectively. No differences in the frequency of different types of bla genes between the sampling points were discerned. Three new variants of -lactamase genes (bla(CMY-157), bla(MOX-13), and bla(FOX-15)) were identified. Four bla genes (bla(TEM-12), bla(TEM-30), bla(TEM-47/68), bla(ACT)) that had never been found in UWTPs were identified in this study. Nine of the identified bla genes had been found in the same environment previously. The bla(FOX-15) variant on a Kluyvera sp. plasmid and bla(GES) type on Raoultella spp. plasmids were observed for the first time in these genera. There was a decrease in the number of multidrug resistant strains in the effluent compared to the influent. Finally, a significantly higher number of cefotaxime and carbapenem unsusceptible strains were detected in the influent than in the effluent. The results strongly support the hypothesis of UWTPs as a hot spot for antibiotic resistant genes (ARGs) and antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) accumulation and indicate that -lactamase genes are widely disseminated among gram-negative rods isolated from this environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,SPECTRUM BETA-LACTAMASES;ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE;KLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE;ESCHERICHIA-COLI;CLASS-A;AQUATIC ENVIRONMENT;AEROMONAS SPP.;ENTEROBACTERIACEAE;BACTERIA;INTEGRONS;Lactams,,

This study investigated the spatiotempora I variability of bubble and diffusive CH4 emissions from a subtropical reservoir, including its upstream and downstream rivers, in eastern China. There was no obvious seasonal variation in CH4 emissions from the main reservoir, which increased slightly from the first half year to the next half year. In the upstream river, CH4 emissions were low from February to June and fluctuated widely from July to January due to bubble activity. In the downstream river, CH4 emissions were lowest in February, which was possibly influenced by the low streamflow rate from the reservoir (275 m(3) s(-2) ) and a short period of mixing. There was spatial variability in CH4 emissions, where fluxes were highest from the upstream river (3.65 +/- 3.24 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)) and lowest from the main reservoir (0.082 +/- 0.061 mg CH4 m(-2) h(-1)), and emissions from the downstream river were 0.49 +/- 0.20 mg CH(4)m(-2) h(-1).

The simulated and measured results are compared to validate the numerical model and confirm the existence of spline friction. The results indicate that spline friction can lead to the attenuation of contact pressure on friction pairs along the axial direction. Therefore, there exists a significant temperature gradient in the axial direction, and the maximum temperature appears in the second separate plate near the piston. Moreover, the friction torque of a single pair decreases along the axial direction. Thus, as the number of friction pair increases, the total friction torque increases nonlinearly, and the average torque of single friction pair decreases gradually.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,FINITE-ELEMENT-ANALYSIS;WEAR PERFORMANCE;WET CLUTCH;HOT-SPOTS;BEHAVIOR;TORQUE;BRAKE;Thermodynamics,,

The Haean catchment is a well-known upland agricultural area in South Korea, which generates a large amount of sediment from its cropland. The transportation of nutrient-rich sediment to the stream adversely affects the water quality of the Han River watershed, which supports over twenty million people. In this paper, we suggest a spatially explicit mitigation method to reduce the amount of sediment yield to the stream of the catchment by converting soil erosion hot spots into forest. To evaluate the effectiveness of this reconfiguration, we estimated the sediment redistribution rate and assessed the soil erosion risk in the Haean catchment using the daily based Morgan-Morgan-Finney (DMMF) model. We found that dry crop fields located in the steep hill-slope suffer from severe soil erosion, and the rice paddy, orchard, and urban area, which are located in a comparatively lower and flatter area, suffer less from erosion. Although located in the steep hill-slope, the forest exhibits high sediment trapping capabilities in this model. When the erosion-prone crop lands were managed by sequentially reconfiguring their land use and land cover (LULC) to the forest from the area with the most severe erosion to the area with the least severe erosion, the result showed a strong reduction in sediment yield flowing to the stream. A change of 3% of the catchment's crop lands of the catchment into forest reduced the sediment yield entering into the stream by approximately 10% and a change of 10% of crop lands potentially resulted in a sediment yield reduction by approximately 50%. According to these results, identifying erosion hot spots and managing them by reconfiguring their LULC is effective in reducing terrestrial sediment yield entering into the stream.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SOIL-EROSION;WATER-QUALITY;LAND-USE;DIFFERENTIAL EVOLUTION;SENSITIVITY-ANALYSIS;GLOBAL OPTIMIZATION;FILTER STRIPS;MODEL;MANAGEMENT;CULTIVATION;Korea,,

This finding raises the question whether cities might in fact be the hot spots for TBDs.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,CANDIDATUS NEOEHRLICHIA-MIKURENSIS;HUMAN GRANULOCYTIC EHRLICHIOSIS;VOLES CLETHRIONOMYS-GLAREOLUS;BURGDORFERI SENSU-LATO;LAKE DISTRICT        REGION;ANAPLASMA-PHAGOCYTOPHILUM;BANK VOLES;BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI;PHYLOGENETIC ANALYSIS;DEVELOPMENTAL-STAGES;Ticks,,

To provide scientifically grounded urban management and reclamation strategies for polluted sites, the spatial patterns of pollutants should be studied first by drawing a special focus on the identification of pollution hot spots. In this paper, Pb, Mo and Ti contents in Yerevan urban soils determined by the combination of X-ray fluorescence and atomic absorption spectrometry were studied using the Local Moran's I index (LMI). These elements (Pb, Mo and Ti) have different sources and a number of distance bands (650, 800, 1000, 1500, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 9000, 10,000m and 15,000 m) were tested. This allows to reveal the optimal distance used for the identification of statistically significant spatial clusters and spatial outliers. According to the results the use of the raw data had to be excluded for elements that demonstrated highly skewed distribution whereas transformed data allowed to identify larger areas of high and low value spatial clusters. Moreover, the results of the different distance bands showed that the high and low spatial clusters became stable near the optimal distance band of 7000 m in the study area. The latter constituted the 1/3 of the maximum distance between all sample pairs. At this distance, Ti LMI results reflected the natural local geology composition whereas Mo distribution was in line with the known sources of industrial pollution (""Plant of Pure Iron""). In the case of Pb, the high-value spatial clusters were in line with the built-up urban areas and spatially correlated with the prevailing northeast winds. This study confirmed the applicability of LMI in the identification of spatial clusters and outliers at the optimal distance band which might be considered also as a break point of spatial clusters expansion and a guidance for spatial boundary of possible remediation and pollution reduction applications.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CHEMICAL-ELEMENTS;POLLUTION;HOTSPOTS,,

This study was performed in a medium-size city of Villavicencio, Colombia. Copper, lead, nickel, zinc, chromium, manganese, and cadmium in road-deposited sediment (RDS) from different land uses were determined. Multiple geo- and statistical approaches of geographic information system mapping, Pearson correlation, Kruskal-Wallis H, hierarchical cluster analysis (HCA), and principal component analyze (PCA) were employed to assess the influence of land use on the metals' spatial distribution. The enrichment of given metals in RDS was evaluated by geo-accumulation (I-geo) and pollution load (PLI) indexes. The exposure human health risk was assessed by hazard index (HI). Results show that the average contents of the given metals decreased in the order of commercial>residential>highway>government institutions and public parks areas. Commercial areas thereafter always have the highest metals enrichment (I-geo) and pollution level (PLI). HI assessment indicates that child has a higher health risk than adult due to the exposure to metals in RDS. HCA analysis reveals that surface roughness had a more direct influence than land-use type on metals' distribution. Kruskal-Wallis H test further suggests land-use type had a significant influence on certain metals' spatial variation. Two potential (group) sources of geochemical and vehicular sources, along with leaded petrol and paintings, were inferred to be the main contributors to metals in RDS by PCA analysis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;SOURCE APPORTIONMENT;HEALTH-RISK;STREET DUST;CHEMICAL FRACTIONATION;URBAN AREA;POLLUTION;SOILS;CITY;ZN;Colombia;Metals, Heavy",,

From a pedestrian perspective, this study examined the crowd behavior in a commercial area, conducted an onsite observation of people's spatial behaviors, and simulated user movement through data-science-driven approaches. Through the analysis process, we determined the spatial differences among various roads and districts in the commercial area, and according to the user movement simulation, we identified key factors that influence pedestrian spatial behaviors and pedestrian accessibility. Moreover, we used the deformed wheel theory to investigate the spatial structure of the commercial area and the synergetic relationship between the space and pedestrians; deformed wheel theory presents the user flow differences in various places and the complexity of road distribution, thereby enabling relevant parties to develop design plans that integrate space and service provision in commercial areas.

Most fertilizer P used in the global agricultural system comes from mining of nonrenewable phosphate rock deposits located within few countries. However, P contained in livestock manure or urban wastes represents a recyclable source of P. To inform development of P recycling technologies and policies, we examined subnational, national, and global spatial patterns for two intersections of land use affording high P recycling potential: (a) manure-rich cultivated areas and (b) populous cultivated areas. In turn, we examined overlap between P recycling potential and nation-level P fertilizer import dependency. Populous cultivated areas were less abundant globally than manure-rich cultivated areas, reflecting greater segregation between crops and people compared to crops and livestock, especially in the Americas. Based on a global hexagonal grid (290-km(2) grid cell area), disproportionately large shares of subnational ""hot spots"" for P recycling potential occurred in India, China, Southeast Asia, Europe, and parts of Africa. Outside of China, most of the remaining manure-rich or pulous cultivated areas occurred within nations that had relatively high imports of P fertilizer (net P import:consumption ratios >= 0.4) or substantial increases in fertilizer demand between the 2000s (2002-2006) and 2010s (2010-2014). Manure-rich cultivated grid cells (those above the 75th percentiles for both manure and cropland extent) represented 12% of the global grid after excluding cropless cells. Annually, the global sum of animal manure P was at least 5 times that contained in human excreta, and among cultivated cells the ratio was frequently higher (median = 8.9). The abundance of potential P recycling hot spots within nations that have depended on fertilizer imports or experienced rising fertilizer demand could prove useful for developing local P sources and maintaining agricultural independence.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SUSTAINABILITY CHALLENGES;ANTHROPOGENIC PHOSPHORUS;LIVESTOCK        PRODUCTION;ANIMAL PRODUCTION;SOIL-PHOSPHORUS;P FERTILIZER;FOOD;FLOWS;MANAGEMENT;RESOURCE;Phosphorus,,

The previously published geographically weighted regression UHI model was used in order to predict the behaviour of the urban-rural temperature anomaly in different weather patterns in a small city named Ljutomer (8 km(2) of built-up area occupied by 3,500 inhabitants) located in the northeast part of Slovenia. As expected, UHI intensity was significantly higher in the anticyclonic weather pattern compared to cyclonic and advective conditions. The urban-rural temperature contrast was at least recognizable under a turbulent windy atmosphere.

A total of 153 samples were collected from the study area as follows: 51 topsoil samples (TS) (0-10 cm), 51 subsoil samples (SS) (10-20 cm) and 51 deep soil samples (DS) (150 cm). Multivariate statistics combined with spatial analysis were implemented in order to distinguish the sources. Several simple and robust statistical methods were applied to datasets in order to explore their potential in the evaluation of a useful and robust background values. The degree of contamination along with pollution indices were also evaluated. The median soil pseudo total concentrations of the elements were as follows: As 3 mg kg(-1), Co 15 mg kg(-1), Cr 14 mg kg(-1), Cu 25 mg kg(-1), Ni 36 mg kg(-1), Pb 5 mg kg(-1), V 97 mg kg(-1) and Zn 51 mg kg(-1). Multivariate analysis suggests that Cr, Pb, V and Zn are contributed by external sources. The spatial distribution of these elements displays a spatial pattern extending along industrial environments and emission sources. While the other elements show a spatial pattern with a few anthropogenic hot spots dispersed across Hualpen, they were influenced by both anthropogenic and geogenic inputs. The estimate background values determined with the DS samples with median absolute deviation (MAD) method were for As 5 mg kg(-1), Co 20 mg kg(-1), Cr 18 mg kg(-1), Cu 33 mg kg(-1), Ni 45 mg kg(-1), Pb 3 mg kg(-1), V 108 mg kg(-1) and Zn 48 mg kg(-1).

In surface heat urban island (SUHI) studies, extended periods of time, broader regions and local government area (LGA) level have become more crucial and will shed light on causes of UHI. Moreover, the spatial pattern and structure of SUHI will be useful for policy-makers to develop mitigation strategies. This study focused on three objectives. Firstly, analyzing land surface temperature (LST), normalized difference built-up (NDBI) and vegetation (NDVI) indices. Secondly, investigating interrelationships among LST, NDVI, and NDBI. Thirdly, identifying LST patterns in the Melbourne metropolitan area. These objectives were achieved through three different methods. The modified automatic mapping method for the first objective, the correlation analysis for the second, and spatial statistical methods for the third. The methodological innovations of this study were considering LGA in interrelationship analysis among LST, NDBI and NDVI, and calculation of NDVI for each acquisition date. The results indicated that the clustering pattern of LST expanded toward the north-west and south-east during the period of the study. Furthermore, the north-west part of the city has the highest positive (0.6) correlation between NDBI and LST, and the south-east part of the city has the lowest negative (-0.8) correlation betweenNDVI and LST. Themost significant increase and decrease in mean LST happened respectively from January 6th to 22nd 2017, and January 14th to 30th January 2014. The temperature degree altered from 19.61 degrees C to 27.86 degrees C in inner western suburbs, and from 35.49 degrees C to 26.88 degrees C in most LGA's.

OBJECTIVE To examine racial/ethnic differences in geographic access to trauma care in the 3 largest US cities, considering the role of residential segregation and neighborhood poverty.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS A cross-sectional, multiple-methods study evaluated census tract data from the 2015 American Community Survey in Chicago, Illinois; Los Angeles (LA), California; and New York City (NYC), New York (N = 3932). These data were paired to geographic coordinates of all adult level I and II trauma centers within an 8.0-km buffer of each city. Between February and September 2018, small-area analyses were conducted to assess trauma desert status as a function of neighborhood racial/ethnic composition, and geospatial analyses were conducted to examine statistically significant trauma desert hot spots.        MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES In small-area analyses, a trauma desert was defined as travel distance greater than 8.0 km to the nearest adult level I or level II trauma center. In geospatial analyses, relative trauma deserts were identified using travel distance as a continuous measure. Census tracts were classified into (1) racial/ethnic composition categories, based on patterns of residential segregation, including white majority, black majority, Hispanic/Latino majority, and other or integrated; and (2) poverty categories, including nonpoor and poor.        RESULTS Chicago, LA, and NYC contained 798, 1006, and 2128 census tracts, respectively. A large proportion comprised a black majority population in Chicago (35.1%) and NYC (21.4%), compared with LA (2.7%). In primary analyses, black majority census tracts were more likely than white majority census tracts to be located in a trauma desert in Chicago (odds ratio [OR], 8.48; 95% CI, 5.71-12.59) and LA (OR, 5.11; 95% CI, 1.50-17.39). In NYC, racial/ethnic disparities were not significant in unadjusted models, but were significant in models adjusting for poverty and race-poverty interaction effects (adjusted OR, 1.87; 95% CI, 1.27-2.74). In comparison, Hispanic/Latino majority census tracts were less likely to be located in a trauma desert in NYC (OR, 0.03; 95% CI, 0.01-0.11) and LA (OR, 0.30; 95% CI, 0.22-0.40), but slightly more likely in Chicago (OR, 2.38; 95% CI, 1.56-3.64).

In tropical environments, soil processes speed up the degradation of archaeological and environmental records, and relatively ephemeral structures built of mud or clay degrade quickly after abandonment, leaving almost no traces of human activities behind. This paper presents the results of bulk soil and chemical analyses, artefact distribution, and phytolith analysis from the excavation of a daub house at the early medieval site of Unguja Ukuu (c. 7th-14th c. AD), Zanzibar. High-resolution, systematic sampling for microscopic and elemental analyses proved effective in detecting spatial variability in relatively small areas. However, soil chemical enrichment (e.g. Ca, Mg, Mn, P) usually linked to anthropogenic impact on archaeological deposits appears hardly visible in the Unguja Ukuu house deposits. Instead, measurements of a wider range of elements, including trace and rare earth elements (REEs) proved to be important for detecting elemental signatures related to human activities. Contextual sampling of artefacts and phytoliths were crucial to identify sources of chemical enrichment and, thus, build a picture of spatial organisation within the house. The combined multi-scalar sampling strategy with a multi-proxy analytical approach enabled us to define the layout of the daub structure, indoor/outdoor spaces and activity hot-spots. Although macroscopic traces of past activities were almost completely obliterated, archaeological remains of earthen architecture and the use of space can be detected even in such complex tropical settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,RARE-EARTH-ELEMENTS;MULTIELEMENT ANALYSIS;CHEMICAL SIGNATURES;SPATIAL        VARIABILITY;NELSON ISLAND;SONGO MNARA;SITE;ARCHAEOLOGY;RESIDUES;ANCIENT,,

However, few such studies were carried out in China. The present study examined the spatial association between the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus and neighborhood deprivation in Zhejiang, China, from a spatial epidemiology perspective. Materials and Methods Type 2 diabetes mellitus data (2012-2016) in the present study were derived from a population-based diabetes registry system maintained by Zhejiang Provincial Center for Disease Control and Prevention. Principal components analysis was used to combine different socioeconomic variables together into a composited Neighborhood Deprivation Index. We applied the global Moran's I and Anselin's local Moran's I statistics to explore the spatial patterns of type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence and Neighborhood Deprivation Index. Results Type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence (Moran's I: 0.531, P < 0.001) and Neighborhood Deprivation Index (Moran's I: 0.772, P < 0.001) showed positive statistically significant global Moran's I index values, showing a tendency towards clustering. The local Moran's I analyses showed that type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence hot spots were mainly located in urban centers, and type 2 diabetes mellitus incidence cold spots appeared in the provincial capital area (Hangzhou city) and western and south-western regions of Zhejiang; the hot spots of the less deprived areas were concentrated in urban centers (except Lishui city), and the cold spots of the most deprived areas were clustered in western and south-western regions of Zhejiang. Conclusions The study showed that the incidence of type 2 diabetes mellitus was higher in affluent areas than the deprived areas across the study period. It will be significant to focus preventive efforts on the least deprived areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,AREA DEPRIVATION;SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;SOCIAL DEPRIVATION;CITY LIGHTS;PREVALENCE;HEALTH;POPULATION;LEVEL;URBAN;ASSOCIATION;China,,

In this study, we developed a framework to assess disaster impacts with social media data, and examined the potential of information extraction with social media messages from Weibo platform to inform disaster response and recovery in China, using the case of 2016 Wuhan rainstorm and flood disaster. Temporal evolution of social media activities was investigated to track the process of the disaster, and further compared with observed precipitation data. Moreover, major impacts of the disaster were assessed through word frequency analysis of impact-related topics. Finally, place-related information were extracted to map the hotspots of the disaster. The results indicate that temporal variation of social media activities was consistent with the rainstorm process and significant positive correlation was found between social media activities and precipitation intensity. Word frequency analysis of impact-related topics revealed that transportation and daily life were most affected, meanwhile impacts on people's emotion and psychological activities were also notable. For hot spots affected by the disaster, more flooded sites were found in central urban districts, which are generally residential/industrial area or roads and other traffic-related places. This study demonstrated the utility of social media for disaster assessment, however ensuring the accuracy of online information and expanding the application for all phases of disaster management still pose substantial challenges for future research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,TWITTER;INFORMATION;Disasters;China,,

However, the frequent occurrence of wildfires is one of the challenges to the success of this method. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effects of wildfires on forest dynamics in Atlantic Forest. The studied area was explored during the coffee cycle when plantations replaced primary forests. We used remote sensing data to analyze the forest dynamics over a period of 50 years (1966-2016). We used the INPE burn database to find the occurrence of hot spots from 1998 to 2016. During this period, we selected the years most affected by the fires for the identification of fire scars using the Normalized Burn Ratio spectral index. From this set of information, we used the methodology of weights of evidence to relate forest dynamics and wildfire events with biophysical and anthropic variables. The results showed that in 1966 the forest area accounted for 8.01% of the land cover, and in 2016 this number rose to 18.55% due to the spontaneous natural regeneration process. The regenerating areas were mainly related to the proximity of the remaining fragments and the portions of the landscape receiving the least amount of global solar radiation. The proximity to urban areas, roads and highways, damaged regeneration and favored both deforestation and wildfire events. Fire scars preferentially occur where there is greater sun exposure. It is possible to observe a negative correlation between the natural regeneration process and the fire scars. We concluded that fire severity is one of the factors that shape the landscape of the region while slowing the regeneration process in preferential areas. (C) 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Based on long-term (1973-2017) surface observations from 73 selected stations, including 60 automated surface observing systems (ASOSs) operated by Korea Meteorological Administration (KMA) and 13 by North Korea, this study examines the spatial variation of the occurrence frequency of heatwave and tropical night in Korea and their long-term trend. The spatial pattern of the heatwave occurrence frequency has different unique features from that of the tropical night. Heatwave develops more frequently in the southern inland regions, while tropical night occurs more in the southern coastal regions and in the urban areas. These hot spots for heatwave and tropical night exhibit a significant positive trend as well. It is also noticeable that the heatwave becomes more frequent in May and September in recent decades. Development mechanisms for heatwave and tropical night are further examined, particularly based on the relationship with cloud fraction. The occurrence frequency of heatwave is correlated negatively with the cloud fraction throughout the warm season, which indicates the daytime temperature is increasing by low cloud fraction. On the other hand, the occurrence frequency of tropical night shows a positive correlation with cloud fraction in May and September, suggesting that the nighttime temperature is effectively increased by enhanced greenhouse effect by cloud for early and late summer. However, the correlation becomes negative in mid-summer (June to August), in which the increased daytime temperature with low cloud fraction tends to affect the nighttime temperature as well. Because of this, the tropical night is more likely accompanied by the heatwave in recent decades.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SOUTH-KOREA;WAVES;URBANIZATION;TEMPERATURE;MORTALITY;Korea,,

However, it is difficult to obtain a more accurate commercial area boundary in the past. Check-in data obtained by a social networking service (SNS) and/or a location-based service (LBS) is a type of crowd-sourced geographic data that can reveal mass daily life activities, which provides a new big data source for urban hot spot detection and commercial area analysis. In this paper, a dynamic urban commercial area extraction and monitoring approach is proposed using SINA Weibo (a social network) check-in data. First, a check-in data pre-process model is proposed to simplify the amount of check-in data and improve the efficiency of cluster analysis. The spatial autocorrelation validation is implemented to validate the significant patterns of the spatial clustering of check-in data. Then, an exploratory spatial analysis and hot spot clustering method based on check-in data is proposed to detect urban hot spots and extract commercial areas using a geographic distribution metric with urban commercial hot spots. Second, the hot spot cluster analysis results are taken to determine the center of the commercial area and calculate the distribution of an ellipse, which is adopted to obtain the rough boundary of the commercial area. A planar Delaunay iterative triangulation algorithm is presented to determine the exact boundary of the commercial area. Then, the time sequence extraction result of the commercial area is presented to analyze the evolutionary trend in the city business space. Finally, the Weibo check-in data from 2012 to 2014 of Wuhan city are taken as an example dataset for the commercial area extraction and detection with the proposed approach. The results show that the method can accurately determine the boundary of and changes within the commercial area in Wuhan city.

While the role of the urban built environment in fostering disaster resilience has been recognized for some time, it has been difficult to translate this potential into practice. This is especially challenging in the case of rapid onset crises such as near-field tsunamis when appropriate urban forms must support the populations' ability to autonomously carry out safe and timely responses. In this respect, much of current research remains focused on large-scale elements of urban configuration (streets, squares, parks, etc.,) through which people move during an emergency. In contrast, the critical micro-scale of evacuees' experiences within the built environment is not commonly examined. This paper addresses this shortfall through a macro- and micro-scale analysis of a near-field tsunami scenario affecting the city of Vina del Mar, Chile, including a mixed-methods approach that combines computer-based models and fieldwork. The results show significant macro-scale tsunami vulnerability throughout major areas of the city, which nonetheless could be mitigated by existing nearby high ground and an urban form that allows short evacuation times. However, micro-scale outcomes show comparatively deficient spatial conditions that during an emergency might lead to dangerous outcomes including bottlenecks, falls and panic. Vertical evacuation, in turn, is confirmed as a suitable option for reducing vulnerability, but further examination of each shelter's characteristics is required.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,RISK REDUCTION;DISASTER;CITY;EARTHQUAKE;PADANG;COUNTERMEASURES;VULNERABILITIES;CONFIGURATION;PREPAREDNESS;RESILIENCE,,

While detailed and continuous assessments of surface permeability and UHI are crucial for urban planning and management of landuse zones, they mostly involve time consuming and expensive field studies and single sensor derived large scale aerial and satellite imageries. We demonstrated the advantage of fusing imageries from multiple sensors for landuse and landcover (LULC) change assessments as well as for assessing surface permeability and temperature and UHI emergence in a fast growing city, i.e. Tirunelveli, Tamilnadu, India. IRS-LISSIII and Landsat-7 ETM+ imageries were fused for 2007 and 2017, and classified using a Rotation Forest (RF) algorithm. Surface permeability and temperature were then quantified using Soil-Adjusted Vegetation Index (SAVI) and Land Surface Temperature (LST) index, respectively. Finally, we assessed the relationship between SAVI and LST for entire Tirunelveli as well as for each LULC zone, and also detected UHI emergence hot spots using a SAVI-LST combined metric. Our fused images exhibited higher classification accuracies, i.e. overall kappa coefficient values, than non-fused images. We observed an overall increase in the coverage of urban (dry, real estate plots and built-up) areas, while a decrease for vegetated (cropland and forest) areas in Tirunelveli between 2007 and 2017. The SAVI values indicated an extensive decrease in surface permeability for Tirunelveli overall and also for almost all LULC zones. The LST values showed an overall increase of surface temperature in Tirunelveli with the highest increase for urban built-up areas between 2007 and 2017. LST also exhibited a strong negative association with SAVI. Southeastern built-up areas in Tirunelveli were depicted as a potential UHI hotspot, with a caution for the Western riparian zone for UHI emergence in 2017. Our results provide important metrics for surface permeability, temperature and UHI monitoring, and inform urban and zonal planning authorities about the advantages of satellite image fusion.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,REMOTE-SENSING TECHNIQUES;LAND-COVER;VEGETATION;TEMPERATURE;TIRUNELVELI;QUALITY;GROWTH;REGION;FOREST;Hot Temperature;Permeability,,

Design/methodology/approach The paper provides an introduction to the use of integer linear programs to create optimal patrol areas, as many analysts and researchers in the author's field will not be familiar with such models. The analysis then introduces a set of linear constraints to the p-median problem that are applicable to police agencies, such as constraining call loads to be equal and making patrol areas geographically contiguous.        Findings The analysis illustrates the technique on simplified simulated examples. The analysis then demonstrates the utility of the technique by showing how patrol areas in Carrollton, TX can be made both more efficient and equalize the call loads given the same number of patrol beats as currently in place.        Originality/value Unlike prior applications of creating patrol areas, this paper introduces linear constraints into the p-median problem, making it much easier to solve than programs that have non-linear or multiple objective functions.

Children in the kindergartens and the primary school students are the main population of scarlet fever and the time distribution of scarlet fever is highly consistent with their school and vacation time. It is suggested that measure for prevention and control of scarlet fever in kindergartens and primary schools is the key to control the epidemic of scarlet fever.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicatas",,HONG-KONG;GIS;China;Q Fever;Fever;Epidemiologic Studies,,

With procedures, such as cleaning, sampling, and so on, the usage count, fixing rate, and network delay data from August 2017 to July 2018 are first analyzed on multiple spatial and temporal scales. The results show that user behavior is strongly correlated to the surveying field work habits.

Based on a cold/hot spots analysis, this paper used grain yield, food prices, price index statistics, and a land use thematic map to study the impact of LUCC on four ecosystem services values (ESVs) in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, and determine the spatial differences resulting from the rapid urbanization LUCC. The correlation between the four ecosystem services was then studied and sensitivity analyses conducted to investigate whether any changes in the ESVs could lead to unacceptable unit value transfer uncertainties. It was found that most urban land was converted from farmland, and that before 2000, the total ESVs and the regulating services values (RSVs) increased significantly, after which it declined, the provisioning services values (PSVs) declined year on year, the habitat services value (HSV) and cultural and amenity services value (CSV) declined sharply after 2000, and the spatial distribution of the four ESVs were significantly different. Over time, it was found that the hot spots were shrinking and the cold spots were spreading. The provisioning services were found to be negatively correlated with habitat services and cultural and amenity services, the regulating services were weakly positively correlated with the provisioning services and significantly positively correlated with the habitat services and cultural and amenity services, and the habitat services were significantly positively correlated with cultural and amenity services. In the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration, the water area is the most important for the total ESVs, followed by non-bush forest. Paddy field is ranked third. Dryland, bush, grassland, and wetland are less important. The importance of barren land is almost zero. This research provides the government with a scientific basis from which to formulate spatial planning and environmental protection policies for ecological sustainable development in the Yangtze River Delta urban agglomeration.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,USE/LAND-COVER CHANGE;TRADE-OFFS;MANAGEMENT;CHINA;CONSERVATION;INTENSITY;SYNERGIES;PROVISION;FRAMEWORK;HOTSPOTS;Cold Temperature,,

Therefore, the goal of the research presented in this paper is to identify specific urban areas where a crime could happen in Manhattan, NY for every hour of a day. The outputs from this research are the following: (i) predicted land uses that generates the top three most committed crimes in Manhattan, by using machine learning (random forest and logistic regression), (ii) identifying the exact hours when most of the assaults are committed, together with hot spots during these hours, by applying time series and hot spot analysis, (iii) built hourly prediction models for assaults based on the land use, by deploying logistic regression. Assault, as a physical attack on someone, according to criminal law, is identified as the third most committed crime in Manhattan. Land use (residential, commercial, recreational, mixed use etc.) is assigned to every area or lot in Manhattan, determining the actual use or activities within each particular lot. While plotting assaults on the map for every hour, this investigation has identified that the hot spots where assaults occur were 'moving' and not confined to specific lots within Manhattan. This raises a number of questions: Why are hot spots of assaults not static in an urban environment? What makes them 'move'-is it a particular urban pattern? Is the 'movement' of hot spots related to human activities during the day and night? Answering these questions helps to build the initial frame for assault prediction within every hour of a day. Knowing a specific land use vulnerability to assault during each exact hour can assist the police departments to allocate forces during those hours in risky areas. For the analysis, the study is using two datasets: a crime dataset with geographical locations of crime, date and time, and a geographic dataset about land uses with land use codes for every lot, each obtained from open databases. The study joins two datasets based on the spatial location and classifies data into 24 classes, based on the time range when the assault occurred. Machine learning methods reveal the effect of land uses on larceny, harassment and assault, the three most committed crimes in Manhattan. Finally, logistic regression provides hourly prediction models and unveils the type of land use where assaults could occur during each hour for both day and night.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,SIMULATION;BURGLARY;Crime,,

The literature shows that the occurrence of crime is frequently concentrated in particular neighbourhoods and is related to a variety of socioeconomic and crime opportunity factors. This study explores the broad patterning of property and violent crime among different socio-economic stratums and across space by examining the neighbourhood socioeconomic conditions and individual characteristics of offenders associated with crime in the city of Toronto, which consists of 140 neighbourhoods. Despite being the largest urban centre in Canada, with a fast-growing population, Toronto is under-studied in crime analysis from a spatial perspective. In this study, both property and violent crime data sets from the years 2014 to 2016 and census-based Ontario-Marginalisation index are analysed using spatial and quantitative methods. Spatial techniques such as Local Moran's I are applied to analyse the spatial distribution of criminal activity while accounting for spatial autocorrelation. Distance-to-crime is measured to explore the spatial behaviour of criminal activity. Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) linear regression is conducted to explore the ways in which individual and neighbourhood demographic characteristics relate to crime rates at the neighbourhood level. Geographically Weighted Regression (GWR) is used to further our understanding of the spatially varying relationships between crime and the independent variables included in the OLS model. Property and violent crime across the three years of the study show a similar distribution of significant crime hot spots in the core, northwest, and east end of the city. The OLS model indicates offender-related demographics (i.e., age, marital status) to be a significant predictor of both types of crime, but in different ways. Neighbourhood contextual variables are measured by the four dimensions of the Ontario-Marginalisation Index. They are significantly associated with violent and property crime in different ways. The GWR is a more suitable model to explain the variations in observed property crime rates across different neighbourhoods. It also identifies spatial non-stationarity in relationships. The study provides implications for crime prevention and security through an enhanced understanding of crime patterns and factors. It points to the need for safe neighbourhoods, to be built not only by the law enforcement sector but by a wide range of social and economic sectors and services.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION;ROUTINE ACTIVITY;TO-CRIME;HOMICIDE;DISORGANIZATION;CONTEXT;ASSOCIATION;OFFENDERS;COMMUNITY;EDUCATION;Crime,,

These analyses are all conducted by the corresponding toolbox of ArcGIS 10.5. Then, a small sized-city of China (i.e., Wujiang) is selected as the case study, and the historical traffic crash data occurring at the road intersections of Wujiang for the year 2016 are analyzed by the proposed method. The analysis process identifies the high incidence locations of traffic crashes, then presents the spatial change trend and statistical significance of the crash locations. Finally, different types of crash hotspots, as well as their evolution patterns over time, are determined. The results illustrate that the traffic crash hotspots of road intersections are primarily distributed in the Northeast area of Wujiang's major urban area, while the crash cold spots are concentrated in the Southwest of Wujiang, which points out the direction for crash prevention.

The aim of this study was to perform an air quality comparison between an urban site (Radvanice), which has a nearby metallurgical complex, and a suburban site (Plesna) to estimate air pollution sources and determine their local and/or regional origins. Twenty-four hour PM1 and PM10 (particular matter) concentrations, detailed mass size distributions (MSDs) to distinguish the sources of the fine and coarse PM, and their chemical compositions were investigated in parallel at both sites during the winter of 2014. Positive matrix factorization (PMF) was applied to the PM1 and PM10 chemical compositions to investigate their sources. During the measurement campaign, prevailing northeastern-southwestern (NE-SW) wind directions (WDs) were recorded. Higher average PM10 concentration was measured in Radvanice than in Plesna, whereas PM1 concentrations were similar at both sites. A source apportionment analysis revealed six and five sources for PM10 and PM1, respectively. In Radvanice, the amount of PM and the most chemical species were similar under SW and NE WD conditions. The dominant sources were industrial (43% for PM10 and 27% for PM1), which were caused by a large metallurgical complex located to the SW, and biomass burning (25% for PM10 and 36% for PM1). In Plesna, the concentrations of PM and all species significantly increased under NE WD conditions. Secondary inorganic aerosols were dominant, with the highest contributions deriving from the NE WD. Therefore, regional pollution transport from the industrial sector in Silesian Province (Poland) was evident. Biomass burning contributed 22% and 24% to PM10 and PM1, respectively. The air quality in Ostrava was influenced by local sources and regional pollution transport. The issue of poor air quality in this region is complex.

Threatened species include bees and other pollinators, which deliver important ecosystem services but are sensitive to land use changes. We investigated the impact of urbanisation and vegetation management practices on pollinator abundance, bee diversity, and bee functional traits. We sampled 126 locations in a stratified random design across an urbanisation gradient in two medium-sized cities in the West African Forests biodiversity hot spot, encompassing three management practices (farmed sites; amenity lands, i.e. green spaces managed for aesthetics; informal green spaces), and tested their effect with generalised linear models. Urbanisation did not affect bee abundances or diversity but had a negative impact on both wasp and beetle abundances. There was also a management-mediated impact of urbanisation on bee abundances, which decreased with urbanisation on farmed sites but not amenity land or informal green spaces. Management practices alone influenced bee abundances with farms harbouring fewer bees, and amenity lands fewer beetles. Bee genera occurrence and dominance patterns were influenced by both urbanisation and management, with some otherwise common genera rare in urban areas. Most functional traits were influenced by management, with fewer polylectic bees, cavity-nesting bees and long-tongued bees in farmed sites. Amenity lands hosted smaller bees and fewer savanna specialists. Some traits were influenced by urbanisation, with more long-tongued bees and cavity-nesting bees found in urban areas. Synthesis and applications. Pollinator responses to urbanisation are complex. In our research, we demonstrate how bee, lepidopteran, and non-fruit fly abundances have been maintained across an urbanisation gradient in tropical Africa, but not wasp and beetle abundances. Moreover, bee community composition and the distribution of traits shifted markedly. How green spaces were managed was also critical. We found that farmed sites hosted the lowest bee abundances and amenity lands the fewest beetles. Retaining informal green spaces and amenity lands in African cities, including protecting nesting sites for stingless bees, and limiting pesticide application would be important for conserving bees and the pollination service they provide to both crops and native vegetation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,URBAN AGRICULTURE;CONSERVATION;BIODIVERSITY;DIVERSITY;CITY;DRIVERS;IMPACTS;TRENDS;AREAS,,

Confined and crowded environments that people visit in their day-to-day life (such as town squares, business districts, transport hubs, etc) can act as hot-spots for spreading disease. In this study we explore the link between the use of public transport and the spread of airborne infections in urban environments.        Methods: We study a large number of journeys on the London Underground, which is known to be particularly crowded at certain times. We use publically available Oyster card data (the electronic ticket used for public transport in Greater London), to infer passengers' routes on the underground network. In order to estimate the spread of a generic airborne disease in each station, we use and extend an analytical microscopic model that was initially designed to study people moving in a corridor.        Results: Comparing our results with influenza-like illnesses (ILI) data collected by Public Health England (PHE) in London boroughs, shows a correlation between the use of public transport and the spread of ILI. Specifically, we show that passengers departing from boroughs with higher ILI rates have higher number of contacts when travelling on the underground. Moreover, by comparing our results with other demographic key factors, we are able to discuss the role that the Underground plays in the spread of airborne infections in the English capital.        Conclusions: Our study suggests a link between public transport use and infectious diseases transmission and encourages further research into that area. Results could be used to inform the development of non-pharmacological interventions that can act on preventing instead of curing infections and are, potentially, more cost-effective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SOCIAL INEQUALITIES;SCHOOL CLOSURE;INFLUENZA;NETWORKS;DROPLETS;CHILDREN;London,,

In this study, we use a reduced-complexity model to systematically explore the bedform-induced hyporheic responses to dynamically changing discharge events in systems with different bedform geometries exposed to varying degrees of groundwater flow (under both upwelling and downwelling conditions). With this in mind, we define metrics to quantify the effects of transience: spatial extent of the hyporheic zone, net hyporheic flux, mean residence time, and denitrification efficiency. We find that regional groundwater flow and geomorphological settings greatly modulate the temporal evolution of bedform-induced hyporheic responses driven by a single-peak discharge event. Effects of transience diminish with increasing groundwater upwelling or downwelling fluxes, decreasing bedform aspect ratios, and decreasing channel slopes. Additionally, we notice that increasing discharge intensities can reduce the modulating impacts of regional groundwater flow on the effects of transience but hardly overcomes the geomorphological controls.

The kernel density was characterized by independent single kernel centers with ribbon-like and sporadic distributions of subcenters. The cold and hot spots showed a gradient distribution pattern of cold in the southwest and hot in the central east. These spatial distribution characteristics could be attributed to the following core factors, total wastewater discharge, length of urban drainage pipelines, municipal solid waste collection, daily urban sewage treatment capacity, and investment in urban pollution treatment of wastewater. The findings reveal the current geospatial distribution of black and odorous waters pollution and provide reference for the Chinese government to treat the pollution from several key points.

This study proposes a framework for the identification of vehicle-pedestrian collision hot spots by integrating the information about both the likelihood of the occurrence of vehicle-pedestrian collisions and the potential for the reduction in vehicle-pedestrian crashes. First, a vehicle-pedestrian collision density surface was produced via network kernel density estimation. By assigning a threshold value, possible vehicle-pedestrian hot spots were identified. To obtain the potential for vehicle-pedestrian collision reduction, random forests was employed to model the density with a set of variables describing vehicle and pedestrian flows. The potential for crash reduction was then measured as the difference between the observed vehicle-pedestrian crash density and the prediction produced by the random forests models. The final hotspots were determined by excluding those with a crash reduction value of no more than zero. The method was applied to the identification of hazardous road locations for pedestrians in a district in Shanghai, China. The result indicates that the method is useful for decision-making support.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: GIS,KDE,Cluster,Neural Networks,StatisticalMethods | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Específico | USER-NOTES: {""Fagner ""=>[""P 84\nCS 3.9""]}",,TRAFFIC CRASH;CONSTRAINED CLUSTERS;SPATIAL-PATTERNS;LOCAL INDICATORS;LINK-ATTRIBUTE;NEURAL-NETWORK;LAND-USE;REGRESSION;CLASSIFICATION;SYSTEM;China;Trees,,

Results show that the heavy metal concentrations in the sediments have increased over the last few decades, especially for Cd and Pb; and the sites in the downstream area, e.g., Badong (BD) and Wushan (WS), have had greater increments of heavy metal concentrations. The sampling sites from S6 to S12-WS are identified as hot spots for heavy metal distribution and have relatively high heavy metal concentrations, and there are also high values for the sites affected by urban cities (e.g., the concentrations of Zn, Cd, Cr and Ni for the site S12-WS). Overall, the heavy metal concentrations increased slightly along the mainstream due to pollutants discharged along the Yangtze River and sediment sorting in the reservoir, and the values in the mainstream were greater than those in the tributaries. Meanwhile, the heavy metal concentrations were generally positively correlated with water depth (especially for Ni), while negatively correlated with dissolved oxygen, turbidity, and median sediment size. These environmental variables have a great impact on the partition of heavy metals between the sediment and overlying water. According to the risk assessment, the heavy metals in the surface sediments of TGR give a low to moderate level of pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"SURFACE-MORPHOLOGY;RIVER SEDIMENTS;ECOLOGICAL RISK;TRACE-METALS;PHOSPHORUS;TRANSPORT;POLLUTION;CHINA;TRANSFORMATION;FRACTIONATION;Metals, Heavy",,

However, it remains undetermined if its impact is independent of individual socioeconomic status. In this study, we evaluated the spatial distribution of mammography adherence in the state of Geneva (Switzerland) using individual-level data and assessed its independence from socioeconomic status (SES). Methods Georeferenced individual-level data from the population-based cross-sectional Bus Sante study (n = 5002) were used to calculate local indicators of spatial association (LISA) and investigate the spatial dependence of mammography adherence. Spatial clusters are reported without adjustment; adjusted for neighborhood income and individual educational attainment; and demographic factors (age and Swiss nationality). The association between adjusted clusters and the proximity to the nearest screening center was also evaluated. Results Mammography adherence was not randomly distributed throughout Geneva with clusters geographically coinciding with known SES distributions. After adjustment for SES indicators, clusters were reduced to 56.2% of their original size (n = 1033). Adjustment for age and nationality further reduced the number of individuals exhibiting spatially dependent behavior (36.5% of the initial size). The identified SES-independent hot spots and cold spots of mammography adherence were not explained by proximity to the nearest screening center. Conclusions SES and demographic factors play an important role in shaping the spatial distribution of mammography adherence. However, the spatial clusters persisted after confounder adjustment indicating that additional neighborhood-level determinants could influence mammography adherence and be the object of targeted public health interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,INEQUALITIES;SMOKING;HEALTH;Urban Population;Mammography,,

A first and critical important step in the implementation of LDN is assessing the current land condition using not only active restoration of degraded land, but also targeting land degradation drivers behind the land degradation process. In a first step to achieve these goals, countries were provided a global dataset for three sub-indicators of land degradation: land cover (LC), land productivity dynamics (LPD) and soil organic carbon (SOC). Here, we report on trends in these sub-indicators for the Entity Republic of Srpska (RS) as a part of Bosnia and Herzegovina, which is a key analysis to inform the frame of reference or baseline conditions for the region to evaluate LDN across this region. Global data for LC for the RS indicates a 0.5% loss of forests (6400 ha) over the time period from 2000 to 2010. Of this area, 5000 ha were converted to cropland and an additional 1400 ha was converted to shrubs, grasslands and sparsely vegetated areas. LPD declined over 2.5% (63,500 ha) of the region. SOC declined on land use changed areas by 15.6% (74,609 Mg ha(-1)) over the same time period. Based on global data, we estimated that 3% of the country is in a degraded state. Based on interviews with local stakeholders in 31 local communities, the primary land degradation drivers were identified and validated by team experts. Depopulation and migration to urban centers were identified as the important underlying drivers of land degradation that most municipalities are facing. The most frequent direct drivers of land degradation across this region were land abandonment, floods, drought, erosion and urbanization. Land abandonment, more specifically, has resulted in conversion of agriculturally productive lands to lands dominated by a wide range of invasive species over the last 25 years. Continued land degradation is underpinned by the lack of understanding by stakeholders of the importance of land as a resource. In evaluating the status, trends and drivers of land degradation for this region, we have identified key areas or ""hot spots"" that may be targeted for restoration options and may be used to achieve LDN targets by 2030.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,AGRICULTURAL LAND;SOIL,,

Given existing pyrometry, it is difficult to identify small factories with low burning temperatures. In addition, existing fire detection methods (such as the contextual algorithm) are cumbersome, complex, and contain multiple thresholds to be determined. With the purpose of detecting industrial heat sources efficiently and simply, we introduced a simple method based on the thermal anomaly index (TAI) to detect industrial heat sources. This index was constructed based on Advanced Spaceborne Thermal Emission and Reflection Radiometer (ASTER) thermal infrared (TIR) data with a detectable temperature of 400 K, which is lower than that used in most high-temperature detection methods. By confirming with the Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer Suite (VIIRS) Nightfire product and high-resolution images, the TAI confidently detected almost all hot spots with the VIIRS Nightfire product and detected many hot spots that were undetected by the VIIRS Nightfire product. Based on six images acquired over Tangshan, we determined that 54.52% of hot spots were undetected by the VIIRS Nightfire product, while the TAI method was able to detect these hot spots. With the MODTRAN 5 radiative transfer model, we simulated the high-temperature detection ability of the TAI. Compared with the VIIRS Nightfire product, the TAI is more sensitive when detecting hot spots below 700 K. Thus, this method can potentially detect family workshops engaged in the smallscale combustion of fuel.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ACTIVE FIRE DETECTION;REFLECTION RADIOMETER ASTER;MAP URBAN AREA;SATELLITE DATA;SURFACE-TEMPERATURE;DETECTION ALGORITHM;PRODUCT;MODIS;EMISSION;RESOLUTION;Hot Temperature,,

Recent empirical studies have reported confirmatory evidence of such spatiotemporal diffusion of gun violence. However, existing space/time interaction tests cannot readily distinguish spatiotemporal clustering from spatiotemporal diffusion. This leaves as an open question whether gun violence actually is contagious or merely clusters in space and time. Compounding this problem, gun violence is subject to considerable measurement error with many nonfatal shootings going unreported to police.MethodsUsing point process data from an acoustical gunshot locator system and a combination of Bayesian spatiotemporal point process modeling and classical space/time interaction tests, this paper distinguishes between clustered but non-diffusing gun violence and clustered gun violence resulting from diffusion.ResultsThis paper demonstrates that contemporary urban gun violence in a metropolitan city does diffuse in space and time, but only slightly.ConclusionsThese results suggest that a disease model for the spread of gun violence in space and time may not be a good fit for most of the geographically stable and temporally stochastic process observed.

Recently, sewers have been identified as potential reservoirs. The intermittent injection of sewage into adjacent surface waters is inevitable, due to capacity limitations of the urban drainage system. Information regarding the effect to natural freshwater biofilms (NFB) due to the intermittent contaminations are scarce. Therefore, a fundamental screening is necessary. In April, we placed NFB-attachment constructions in a brook upstream and downstream from urban drainage overflow constructions. In meanwhile two sampling campaigns were conducted. The sewage and the brook water were collected to gather information about antibiotic background exposure of ciprofloxacin (CIP), clarithromycin (CIA) and doxycycline (DOX). Six months later we experimentally determined the oxygen uptake rate (OUR) of the NFB-communities after a 24 h lasting exposure with additionally dosed antibiotics. Concentrations of 0.1, 1.0 and 10.0 mg L-1 were selected. CIP, CIA and DOX were individually dosed, and also in mixtures. The mean antibiotic background concentration in sewage was in a range of 575.5-1289.1 ng L-1, which mainly exceeded the concentrations published in literature. The determined mean concentration in the brook was in a range of 4.6-539.0 ng L-1. The first significant inhibition of the OUR with individually dosed antibiotics started mainly at a concentration of 1.0 mg L-1. Antibiotics in a mixture with concentrations of 0.1 and 1.0 mg L-1 were as effective as single dosed antibiotics with a concentration of 10.0 mg L-1. The increased antibiotic tolerance and resistance of NFB-communities downstream of the combined sewer overflow (CSO) structure was a consequence of a severe impact due to urban drainage overflows. Hence, NFB-communities downstream of CSO-constructions are hot spots of antibiotic tolerant and resistant subpopulations and access restrictions should be announced, if an infection risk is present.

This case study uses Jinjiang, China as a representative of a city experiencing rapid urbanization. We build up a multisource database (forest inventory, digital elevation models, population, and remote sensing imagery) on a uniform coordinate system to support research into the interactions that influence the STUFC. Landsat-5/8 Thermal Mapper images and meteorological data were used to retrieve the temporal and spatial distributions of land surface temperature. Ground observations, which included the forest management planning inventory and population density data, provided the factors that determine the STUFC spatial distribution on an urban scale. The use of a spatial statistical model (GeogDetector model) reveals the interaction mechanisms of STUFC. Although different environmental factors exert different influences on STUFC, in two periods with different hot spots and cold spots, the patch area and dominant tree species proved to be the main factors contributing to STUFC. The interaction between multiple environmental factors increased the STUFC, both linearly and nonlinearly. Strong interactions tended to occur between elevation and dominant species and were prevalent in either hot or cold spots in different years.

A street segment analysis and a group-based trajectory analysis were conducted to test the presence and the stability of crime concentration in the city of Milan (Italy), and negative binomial regression models were run to understand the main determinants of this concentration. The findings confirm the presence of crime concentration at street segment level, but only a few segments can be considered to be highly criminogenic over time. Social disorganization factors play an important role in explaining crime concentration, even though opportunity factors also coincide in this explanation. Despite their differences, cities around the world share the same crime concentration. The generalization of these findings is an important step in the development of common knowledge.

Methods: We used a quasi-experimental design to test whether crime rates changed from preremediation (January 2013-October 2014) to postremediation (July 2016-March 2017) near 204 vacant lots that were remediated compared with 560 control vacant lots that were not remediated between October 2014 and July 2016. We also examined differences between remediated lots that received 1 treatment (n = 64) and those that received >= 2 treatments (n = 140). Results: We found no significant differences between remediated and control lots in levels of violent, property, and domestic crimes from preremediation to postremediation. However, the number of drug crimes per square mile decreased significantly near all remediated lots (5.7% lower; P < .001) compared with control lots, largely driven by the significant decrease (6.4% lower; P < .001) in drug crimes found near lots that received >= 2 treatments. Conclusions: Investing in programs that improve neighborhood environments affected by high rates of physical disorder and vacancy may be a way to decrease violence. However, routine remediation may be needed to increase the public health impact of blight abatement programs in warmer climates, where weeds and vegetation grow rapidly.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,URBAN ADOLESCENTS;VIOLENT CRIME;HOT-SPOTS;HEALTH;EXPOSURE;COMMUNITY;DISORDER;IMPACT;NEIGHBORHOODS;ASSOCIATION;Crime,,

In addition to the socio-economic factors, i.e., GDP and population, vegetation cover, elevation, land-use density and landscape metrics are also considered. Faced with the rapid process of urbanization and the impact of land use change on AOD, which has been confirmed in previous studies, we propose an AOD prediction method, combining a land-use change simulation model, a cellular automata and Markov chain (CA-Markov) model, and spatial relationships built by GWR to represent the spatial distribution of AOD in 2030. The results suggest that the GWR model is able to address the spatially varying relationships, with an R-squared value, corrected Akaike's information criterion (AICc), and standard residual better than those of the ordinary least squares (OLS) model. Land-use simulation, with an accuracy of 89.76%, indicates that an increase in the built-up area and a decrease in the forest area will be the major trends of land-use change and will lead to increased AOD. The AOD simulation results indicate that the most developed areas, i.e., the cities of Wuhan and Huangshi, will be the AOD increase hot spots in the WHA. This study provides an alternative method to identify the varying spatial relationships between AOD and its impact factors. A spatial prediction method for AOD is developed from the perspective of land-use change, which will help land-use planners in decision making.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION;TEMPORAL VARIATIONS;URBAN FORM;CHINA;QUALITY;IMPACT;Factor Analysis, Statistical;Aerosols;Fibrinogen",,

Drawing on the locations of 5,297 drug arrests between 2011and 2013, along with 6,291 surrounding physical features in the environment, the risk terrain modelling framework guided the analyses, which revealed that the risk of drug crimes varies by context and time. Similar to previous research in the United States and the Netherlands, the authors found that 11 out of 18 correlates were significantly associated with drug crimes. Unlike other study settings, the locations of alcohol sales and service did not predict the occurrence of drug crimes in the Durham Region. In addition, the risk clusters differed when the same correlates were modelled for incidents of each year separately. The models provided a valid prediction from one year to the next. Nearly 85% of all places with illicit drugs arrests in 2012 and 2013 overlapped with high-risk places of 2011 and 2012, respectively.

Using geographical information systems, we identified hotspots of alcohol-related health incidents outside of outlet density areas based on the registry of alcohol related ambulance attendances. While quantitative data and methods were used to analyse victim profiles (including age, sex and home address) and temporal profiles (time of incident), we combined quantitative and qualitative information to develop environmental profiles of these hotspots. We identified 11 hotspots with 242 incidents outside outlet density areas. Results indicate substantial differences between incidents in these hotspots and incidents in high outlet density areas. Victims in these hotspots are older, more often male and live closer to the incident location compared to victims in high outlet density hotspots. Incidents are less likely to take place during the night and at weekends. In-depth analysis of four hotspots showed different combinations of contributing environmental factors, including (a) public parks bordering deprived neighbourhoods, (b) dance event facilities close to a traffic black spot, and (c) residential services for disadvantaged groups near hang-outs'. The study shows that hotspots of alcohol-related incidents can arise outside outlet density areas at locations where several other environmental factors cluster, particularly in more deprived areas.

Detached leaf assays were used to evaluate the black spot disease resistance of 75 lines and the two parents. The mean leaf area with symptoms (LAS) of the tested leaves of Porcelina' was 72.0 +/- 12.9%, classifying it as highly susceptible, while R. rugosa showed high resistance to black spot disease. The coefficient of variation in LAS of the progeny was 68.1%, which indicates that the broad-spectrum resistance of rose black spot disease is controlled by multiple genes. A total of 11 progeny had an LAS<10% and were significantly more resistant than the female parent.

Urban planning should account for these extreme events as efficiently as possible. One way is to locate hot spots in an urban environment by mapping cities into local climate zones (LCZ) and evaluate heat stress related to these zones. LCZs are likely to become a standard in urban climate modelling as they capture important urban morphological characteristics. For instance, temperature regimes linked to spatially explicit LCZ maps should be assessed for all LCZ zones derived from these maps. This study assesses the thermal behavior of mapped LCZs using simulated temperature data from the UrbClim model. Prior to temperature analysis, the model was validated with observational data. To evaluate the robustness of the analysis, we ran the model in three cities in Belgium: Antwerp, Brussels, and Ghent. The results show that temperature regimes are significantly different for all the built zones in the urban environment independent of the city. Second, the susceptibility to heat stress can differ greatly depending on the zone. The unique thermal behavior of the different LCZs provides indispensable information on the urban environment and its climatic conditions. This study shows that the LCZ scheme has a potential to help urban planners globally tackle adverse effects of extreme weather events.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: OutroIdioma",,URBAN ENERGY-BALANCE;LAND-SURFACE;THERMAL COMFORT;ISLAND;CITIES;MITIGATION;PARAMETERS;CITY;INFORMATION;VARIABILITY;Hot Temperature,,

We do this through investigation of Canada's residential school system, with specific attention to a single Indian Residential School (IRS) within this system, the Assiniboia Residential School (ARS) in Winnipeg. Assiniboia was different than other residential schools in Canada because, despite playing a role in Indigenous assimilation, students experienced more freedom and less abuse than was characteristic of other schools. We argue that grappling with an institution such as Assiniboia, as part of an experience of state crime, requires that the notion of crime as a temporal event, or as the outcome of a linear criminogenic process, be challenged and opened to concepts of time that are pulsating, uneven and persistent within a broader settler-colonial mesh.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,ROUTINE ACTIVITIES;HOT-SPOTS;CRIME;GOVERNMENTALITY;VICTIMIZATION;DESISTANCE;VIOLENCE;Canada,,

Soil contamination with heavy metals and metalloids has become an increasingly important issue in recent years.        Objectives. The present study examines possible contamination of the environment with metals from gold mining activities in Obuasi, Ghana.        Methods. Soil samples were collected from commercial and residential areas and tailing dams in Obuasi in order to investigate the extent of lead (Pb), cadmium (Cd), mercury (Hg), copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), cobalt (Co), chromium (Cr), nickel (Ni) and arsenic (As) pollution, create thematic maps showing the extent of heavy metals pollution, identify the sources of pollution, and to assess risks to humans and the surrounding ecological system.        Results. Mean concentrations of metals from the study were found in the order of As > Cu > Zn > Cr > Ni > Pb > Co > Hg > Cd. The results showed that all communities were severely polluted with As, and distribution maps highlighted two hot spots at the sulfite treatment plant and Pompura treatment plant tailings dams. Additionally, the levels of Pb, Cu and Zn were elevated around the city center where vehicular traffic is very dense. Principal component analysis indicated that mining activities may have significantly contributed to metal levels in Obuasi soils. The potential ecological risk (RI) indicated that soils in 41% of the communities pose very high risks to the surrounding ecological system, 50% pose considerable risk, and 9% pose a moderate risk. Arsenic and Hg contributed 73 and 15% of the RI, respectively. The average hazard quotient due to soil As exposure was 2.51 +/- 1.23 and ingestion of soils in 95% of the communities in the study area could pose non-carcinogenic health risks to children. Moreover, the average cancer risk for children from the communities was 1.13 x 10(-3). Based on the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) recommendation for cancer risk of 10(-6) to 10(-4), the cancer risk for children (> 10(-3)) was higher in 45% of the studied communities.        Conclusions. The central part of the study area is polluted with Pb, Zn and Cu, and As pollution is severe in all of the studied communities. The RI from all study sites revealed very high risk to the ecological system, including mammals. There could be non-cancer and cancer risks to Obuasi residents due to ingestion of As-contaminated soils, and children are particularly vulnerable.        Competing Interests.

In this study, soil samples collection was conducted in a typical e-waste recycling region (approximately 30 km(2)), and the concentrations of eight trace elements (As, Cd, Cr, Cu, Hg, Ni, Pb, and Zn) were analyzed. Moreover, pollution index, enrichment factor, potential ecological risk, hazard quotient, and hazard index were calculated and used to assess the risk of the ecosystem and human health. The results showed that the mean concentrations of Cd, Cu, and Hg were significantly higher than their standard values of China; the excess portion was 90.2% for Cu, 87.4% for Cd, and 47.6% for Hg, indicating the regional contamination of these metals. The values of enrichment factors further demonstrated that Cd, Cu, and Hg were the most significantly enriched metals in the study area, which might be associated with e-waste activities. On the other hand, the concentrations of Cr and Ni were comparable with their background values, suggesting that they were mainly affected by soil parent materials. Health risk assessment indicated that the carcinogenic risk for the local habitants was unacceptable.

Therefore, in these areas, a detailed evacuation planning of the affected population is required as a risk mitigation measure. The knowledge and enforcement of evacuation routes may reduce the population vulnerability, making it more resilient and reducing risk. This paper presents a GIS approach for modelling evacuation routes based on the optimal path search problem, of the graph theory, which is implemented on ArcCasper tool. The methodology proposed considers the elements involved in the evacuation process, the worst credible tsunami inundation scenario (hazard extent and travel time), the number of people that needs to be evacuated in different time scenarios, the safe areas or destination points of the evacuation routes, the roads network characteristics and finally the time available to evacuate. The knowledge of those elements allows predicting some possible outcomes of the evacuation, such as the arrival time of the evacuees to a shelter and the identification of congestion hot spots resulting from the application of a flocking model which simulates the path to be used by evacuees avoiding obstacles. The municipality of Cascais was used to test the methodology proposed in this study. Cascais is one of the largest urban centres located about 25km west of Lisbon, Portugal, with a high density of infrastructure along the coastline whereby most of the population and economic activities are exposed to a tsunami. The results, presented in the form of maps, allow identifying the optimal evacuation routes as well as the unfeasible routes. This crucial information could be used to the evacuation optimization regarding the location of meeting points and vertical shelters as well as to improve the accessibility of the areas to be evacuated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,POPULATION EXPOSURE;MODEL;Portugal,,

Despite its great success, Wi-Fi is constrained by the over-crowded unlicensed spectrum, which leads to poor user experience, especially in urban areas. This paper introduces an opportunistic cooperation framework that allows mobile service providers (MSPs) to offload traffic onto each other's network by harvesting short-lived spectrum/resources of cellular systems. Specifically, through traffic offloading, MSPs aim to maximize their profit while maintaining their quality of service (QoS) commitments. For that purpose, we model the strategic cooperation between MSPs as a stochastic Markov game in which the dynamics of resource availability and user behaviors are captured via a Markov decision process. We prove that the game is irreducible and admits a Nash Equilibrium at which all MSPs benefit from traffic offloading. A practical algorithm that uses only local information to govern traffic offloading at MSPs is then developed.

Atmospheric nitrogen (N) inputs to aridlands are likely to cause changes in plant community composition, fire frequency, and carbon cycling and storage. However, few studies have documented long-term rates of atmospheric N inputs in arid-lands because dry deposition is technically difficult to quantify, and extensive sampling is needed to capture fluxes with spatially and temporally heterogeneous rainfall patterns. Here, we quantified long-term spatial and temporal patterns of inorganic N deposition in protected aridland ecosystems across an extensive urban-rural gradient using multiple sampling methods. We compared long-term rates of N deposition from ion-exchange resin (IER) collectors (bulk and throughfall, 2006-2015), wet-dry bucket collectors (2006-2015), and dry deposition from the inferential method using passive samplers (2010-2012). From mixed approaches with IER collectors and inferential methods, we determined that 7.2 +/- 0.4 kgNha(-1)y(-1) is deposited to protected Sonoran Desert within metropolitan Phoenix, Arizona and 6.1 +/- 0.3 kgNha(-1)y(-1) in nearby desert ecosystems. Regional scale models overestimated deposition rates for our sampling period by 60% and misidentified hot spots of deposition across the airshed. By contrast, the easy-deployment IER throughfall collectors showed minimal spatial variation across the urban-rural gradient and underestimated deposition fluxes by 54%, largely because of underestimated dry deposition in throughfall. However, seasonal sampling of the IER collectors over 10 years allowed us to capture significant seasonal variation in N deposition and the importance of precipitation timing. These results, derived from the longest, spatially and temporally explicit dataset in drylands, highlight the need for long-term, mixed methods to estimate atmospheric nutrient enrichment to aridlands in a rapidly changing world.

Active agricultural lands extend over a large part of the Veneto region (Eastern Po Valley, Italy) and glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium are widely used. Consequently, surface waters can be potentially contaminated. This study investigates the occurrence of glyphosate and glufosinate ammonium as well as aminomethylphosphonic acid (AMPA, the degradation product of glyphosate) in river water of Veneto. Eighty-six samples were collected in 2015 at multiple sampling points across the region. Samples were analyzed for the two target herbicides, AMPA as well as for other variables, including water temperature, pH, dissolved oxygen, conductivity, hardness, BOD, COD, inorganic ions, total nitrogen, total phosphorus, total suspended solids, arsenic, and lead. The average concentrations (all samples) were 0.17, 0.18, and 0.10 mu g L-1 for glyphosate, AMPA, and glufosinate ammonium, respectively. The European upper tolerable level for pesticides (annual average 0.1 mu g L-1) was often exceeded. Chemometric analysis was therefore applied to (i) investigate the relationships among water pollutants, (ii) detect the potential sources of water contamination, (iii) assess the effective water pollution of rivers by identifying river basins with anomalous pollution levels, and (iv) assess the spatial variability of detected sources. Factor analysis identified four factors interpreted as potential sources and processes (use of herbicides, leaching of fertilizers, urban/industrial discharges, and the biological activity on polluted or stagnant waters). A discriminant analysis revealed that the pollution from anthropogenic discharges is homogeneously present in surface water of Veneto, while biological activity and fertilizers present heterogeneous distributions. This study gives insights into the concentrations of herbicides in rivers flowing through a wide region that has heavy use of these chemicals in agriculture. The study also points out some hot-spots and suggests the future implementation of the current monitoring protocols and network.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,EMERGING ORGANIC CONTAMINANTS;SURFACE WATERS;VENICE LAGOON;WASTE-WATER;AGRICULTURAL BASINS;MIDWESTERN STREAMS;RISK-ASSESSMENT;NATURAL-WATERS;GROUNDWATER;SOIL;Italy,,

One-year of monitoring was conducted in 338 cities at or above the prefectural level in China. Spatial hot spots of PM2.5 were analyzed using exploratory spatial data analysis. Meteorological factors affecting PM2.5 distributions were analyzed. The results indicate the following: (1) Diurnal variations of PM2.5 exhibited a Wshaped trend, with the lowest value observed in the afternoon. The peak concentrations occurred after the ends of the morning and evening rush hours. (2) Out of 338 cities, 235 exceeded the national annual PM2.5 standards (535 mu g/m(3)), with slightly polluted (75-115 mu g/m(3)) cities occupying the greatest proportion. (3) The attainment rate showed an inverted U-shape, while there was a U-shaped pattern observed for daily and monthly mean PM2.5. (4) The spatial distribution of PM2.5 concentrations varied greatly, PM2.5 has significant spatial autocorrelation and clustering characteristics. Hot spots for pollution were mainly concentrated in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei area and neighboring regions, in part because of the large amount of smoke and dust emissions in this region. However, weather factors (temperature, humidity, and wind speed) also had an effect. In addition, southwest Xinjiang experienced heavy PM2.5 pollution that was mainly caused by the frequent occurrence of sandstorms, although no significant relationship was observed between PM2.5 and meteorological elements in this region.

Satellite-based estimation of urban energy fluxes at neighbourhood scale is still a challenge. Here we show the potential of the current satellite missions to retrieve urban energy budget fluxes, supported by meteorological observations and evaluated by direct flux measurements. We found an agreement within 5% between satellite and in-situ derived net all-wave radiation; and identified that wall facet fraction and urban materials type are the most important parameters for estimating heat storage of the urban canopy. The satellite approaches were found to underestimate measured turbulent heat fluxes, with sensible heat flux being most sensitive to surface temperature variation (-64.1, +69.3 W m(-2) for +/- 2 K perturbation). They also underestimate anthropogenic heat fluxes.

The spatial evaluation of urban waterlogging risk represents an essential analytic step that can be used to prevent urban waterlogging and minimize related losses. The Weighted Naive Bayes (WNB) classifier is a powerful method for knowledge discovery and probability inference under conditions of uncertainty; a WNB classifier can be applied to estimate the likelihood of hazards. Six spatial factors were considered to be added to the WNB, which may improve the efficiency in predicting urban waterlogging risk during analysis. As such, a spatial framework integrating WNB with GIS was developed to assess the risk of urban waterlogging using the primary urban area of Guangzhou in China as an example.

However, few studies have quantitatively investigated the spatial non-stationarity and spatial scale effects of the relationships between LST and its impact factors at multi-scales. The main purposes of this study are as follows: (1) to estimate the spatial distributions of urban heat island (UHI) intensity by using hot spots analysis and (2) to explore the spatial non-stationarity and scale effects of the relationships between LST and related impact factors at multiple resolutions (30-1200 m) and to find appropriate scales for illuminating the relationships in a plain city. Based on the LST retrieved from Landsat 8 OLI/TIRS images, the Geographically-Weighted Regression (GWR) model is used to explore the scale effects of the relationships in Zhengzhou City between LST and six driving indicators: The Fractional Vegetation Cover (FVC), the Impervious Surface (IS), the Population Density (PD), the Fossil-fuel CO2 Emission data (FFCOE), the Shannon Diversity Index (SHDI) and the Perimeter-area Fractal Dimension (PAFRAC), which indicate the vegetation abundance, built-up, social-ecological variables and the diversity and shape complexity of land cover types. Our findings showed that the spatial patterns of LST show statistically significant hot spot zones in the center of the study area, partly extending to the western and southern industrial areas, indicating that the intensity of the urban heat island is significantly spatial clustering in Zhengzhou City. In addition, compared with the Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) model, the GWR model has a better ability to characterize spatial non-stationarity and analyze the relationships between the LST and its impact factors by considering the space-varying relationships of different variables, especially at the fine spatial scales (30-480 m). However, the strength of GWR model has become relatively weak with the increase of spatial scales (720-1200 m). This reveals that the GWR model is recommended to be applied in the analysis of UHI problems and related impact factors at scales finer than 480 m in the plain city. If the spatial scale is coarser than 720 m, both OLS and GWR models are suitable for illustrating the correct relationships between UHI effect and its influence factors in the plain city due to their undifferentiated performance. These findings can provide valuable information for urban planners and researchers to select appropriate models and spatial scales seeking to mitigate urban thermal environment effect.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,URBAN HEAT-ISLAND;FRACTIONAL VEGETATION COVER;LANDSCAPE PATTERN;THERMAL COMFORT;ENERGY USE;CITY;INDEX;SHANGHAI;IMAGERY;METRICS;Temperature,,

The fast response time of the analyzers, which results in 100 Hz data, makes accurate time-alignment with the vehicle's engine control unit (ECU) signals possible.

This was combined with a high-resolution 3D geological model of the subsurface of the Netherlands to map the proportions of organic matter, clastic sediment and void space in peat.        The 3D model indicates that c. 15 km(3) of Holocene peat is embedded in the coastal-deltaic plain subsurface, of which c. 1.5 km(3) consists of organic matter, 0.4 km(3) of sediment, and 13.1 km(3) of void space. During future human-induced oxidation, this peat has a volumetric loss potential of 14.6 km(3), responsible for locally 0.4-6.0 m of subsidence, and a CO2 emission of 2.0 Gton.        The 3D modelling revealed that the amount of peat organic matter varies considerably between regions. Especially the subsurface of urban areas overlying back-barrier peat were identified as hot-spots accommodating the highest quantities of peat organic matter. The peat in agricultural areas contains less organic matter but is more prone to oxidation than peat underlying urban areas, because in the latter settings anthropogenic brought-up soil restricts oxidation. Future mitigation strategies should therefore focus on restricting peat oxidation in the agricultural areas of the coastal-deltaic plain. (C) 2018 Elsevier Ltd.

In this study, we aim to map recreation supply, demand, and flow, combining different approaches and data sources, including spatially explicit indicators and crowd-sourced information from social media. We analyse spatial and temporal patterns in the European Alps and their surrounding areas (Alpine Space area) and explore societal preferences. Our results indicate that especially mountainous areas provide high ecosystem service supply, while high demand is characteristic of strongly urbanised areas. The spatio-temporal pattern of flow hot spots shows two major trends: recreational landscapes around urban agglomerations are frequented all year round, whereas visitation rates in remote mountain areas depend greatly on the season. By means of a cluster analysis, we identify five types of municipalities, distinguishing municipalities with little importance for recreation, prevailing demand, or supply, and highly used areas. Further, our results suggest that societal preferences can be explained by landscape attributes and tourism infrastructure. In addition to revealing a large-scale spatio-temporal pattern, this study explores methodological possibilities to provide a basis for decision-making and landscape planning regarding recreational ecosystem services.

This study assessed the diversity of three indicator taxa - plants, ants and birds - on golf courses spanning a wide range of environmental variation in terms of climate, elevation, course age, size and connectivity to native woodland. Species richness and community composition was further compared between contrasting on-course habitat types that reflect different management intensities. We identified a set of taxon-specific environmental correlates indicating an intricate interplay of landscape- and local-scale variables that affect local species diversity. Our results show that floristic diversity is positively associated with the amount of rainfall, whereas ant and bird diversity are related to local-scale factors, particularly the number of trees and the size of water features on a site. The amount of on-course native habitat was a strong predictor of plant and ant diversity and was also associated with the number of unique species at the site level; this reinforces the value of remnant habitat patches as local biodiversity reservoirs that represent mini hot-spots in an otherwise species-poor urban landscape. Community composition for all three taxa differed markedly between non-playing and playing areas, with boundary and remnant habitats generally having more diverse, species-rich communities. Our results suggest that local floral and faunal biodiversity on urban golf courses can be enhanced by creating woody non-playing areas and, especially, by preserving, restoring or expanding remnant habitats.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION;COMMUNITY COMPOSITION;GLOBAL PATTERNS;ANTS;MANAGEMENT;ECOLOGY;CITIES;MODEL;BIOINDICATORS;URBANIZATION;Animal Shells;Animals,,

Jilin Province is an important agricultural province in China. The contradiction between population, industry and land urbanization is especially prominent here, and its coupling development is of great practical significance. In this paper, the coupling degree of population-industry-land urbanization in Jilin Province in 1990, 2000 and 2010 is measured by coupling mode. The spatial pattern of the coupling degree is analyzed by trend surface analysis and global and local spatial autocorrelation. The influence factors and their spatial differentiation are discussed using multiple linear regression (MLR) model and geographic weighted regression (GWR) model. The results show that: 1) the coupling degree of population-industry-land urbanization in Jilin Province is at a low level. Judging from the change of time scale, the urbanization of most research units is becoming more and more coordinated. From the comparison of spatial scales, there is significant spatial difference in the research units of different administrative levels. 2) Judging from the global change trend, the coupling degree of population-industry-land urbanization in the central region is higher than that in western and eastern regions. The coordination of urbanization in the central region is relatively good, and the distribution of the cold and hot spots is basically the same as that overall. 3) The spatial pattern of the coupling degree is related to the cold and hot spot distribution of the influence coefficient of urban population density and per capita urban construction land. The variation of the coupling degree spatial pattern is synchronous with the spatial change of the urban population density influence coefficient. 4) The degree of agglomeration of the urban population is the main factor promoting the coupling pattern of population-industry-land urbanization in Jilin Province, and the extent of its influence is gradually increasing. In addition, the level of city administrative, the efficiency of urban expansion and the capacity of market consumption also have an important influence on the coupling pattern.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION;SPATIAL ASSOCIATION;GROWTH;INEQUALITY;AREA;China,,

Furthermore, gardens provide a wide range of ecosystem services, including carbon (C) storage and nutrient cycling. Although the soil is the foundation of sustainable gardens providing those ecosystem services, very little is known about the consequences of garden management on soil quality. Here we present a comprehensive assessment of urban garden soil quality, including biotic and abiotic site characteristics combined with land-use history and garden management information in a multivariate evaluation. A set of 44 soil quality indicators was measured at 170 sites of 85 gardens in the city of Zurich, Switzerland, comprising contrastingly managed garden habitats along a gradient of urban density. Taken together, our results show that garden management was the driving factor that influenced soil quality and soil functions. Eco-physiological soil quality indices were useful to identify differences in disturbance and intensity of soil use, showing highest microbial [microbial biomass (C-m(i)c)/soil organic carbon (SOC)] and lowest metabolic (qCO(2)) quotients in perennial grass sites compared to annual vegetable sites. Despite the intensity of soil disturbance in annual vegetable and flower beds, the highest endogeic earthworm biomass and diversity were found in those habitats. Whereas decomposition of green tea bags was higher in grass sites. Soil heavy metal contents varied considerably and could not be linked with garden management practices, but with spatial patterns of industry and traffic. We conclude that understanding soil quality in urban ecosystems needs multi-indicator frameworks to capture the complexity of soil characteristics and the influencing factors in space and time. This study contributes to a better understanding of urban gardens and enhances the development of sustainable soil management strategies aimed at long-term improvement of soil quality and related ecosystem services in cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ORGANIC-MATTER;LAND-USE;MICROBIAL BIOMASS;BIODIVERSITY CONSERVATION;EARTHWORM COMMUNITIES;SPATIAL HETEROGENEITY;LITTER DECOMPOSITION;DIFFUSE-REFLECTANCE;ECOSYSTEM SERVICES;EXTRACTION METHOD,,

This species is currently suffering from the local impacts of climate change associated with urbanisation. Two suburbs of Wellington, New Zealand, that are used seasonally by Little Penguin as terrestrial habitat were selected as the study area to address two issues: (i) how local impacts of climate change may affect the population and habitat structure of species in urban coastal zones where land cover change occurs; and (ii) how landscape management practices may help to mitigate the impacts imposed by climate change on the species in such a context. Remote Sensing and Geographical Information Systems techniques were applied to quantify and measure the extent of the prehuman forests and current land cover classes in the study area to reveal the degree to which land cover has changed from predevelopment to the present time. The research shows that land cover change in the study area has been widespread and partly irreversible, particularly in areas covered by the class Built-up Area.

Many epidemiological studies rely on empirical modelling techniques, such as land use regression (LUR), to evaluate ambient air exposure. Previous studies have located monitoring stations in an ad hoc fashion, favouring their placement in traffic ""hot spots"", or in areas deemed subjectively to be of interest to land use and population. However, ad-hoc placement of monitoring stations may lead to uninformed decisions for long-term exposure analysis. This paper introduces a systematic approach for identifying the location of air quality monitoring stations. It combines the flexibility of LUR with the ability to put weights on priority areas such as highly-populated regions, to minimise the spatial mean predictor error. Testing the approach over the study area has shown that it leads to a significant drop of the mean prediction error (99.87% without spatial weights; 99.94% with spatial weights in the study area). The results of this work can guide the selection of sites while expanding or creating air quality monitoring networks for robust LUR estimations with minimal prediction errors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,POLLUTION EXPOSURE;SPATIAL VARIABILITY;SAMPLING DESIGN;URBAN AREAS;NO2;POLLUTANTS;PREDICTION;PATTERNS;IMPACTS;EUROPE,,

Monitoring the spatial patterns and trajectories of UHI formations could be helpful to urban planners in crafting appropriate mitigation and adaptation measures. This study examined the spatial pattern of SUHI formation in the Colombo District (Sri Lanka), based on land surface temperature (LST), a normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI), a normalized difference built-up index (NDBI), and population density (PD) using a geospatial-based hot and cold spot analysis tool. Here, 'hot spots' refers to areas with significant spatial clustering of high variable values, while 'cold spots' refers to areas with significant spatial clustering of low variable values. The results indicated that between 1997 and 2017, 32.% of the 557 divisions in the Colombo District persisted as hot spots. These hot spots were characterized by a significant clustering of high composite index values resulting from the four variables (LST, NDVI (inverted), NDBI, and PD). This study also identified newly emerging hot spots, which accounted for 49 divisions (8.8%). Large clusters of hot spots between both time points were found on the western side of the district, while cold spots were found on the eastern side of the district. The areas identified as hot spots are the more urbanized parts of the district. The emerging hot spots were in areas that had undergone landscape changes due to urbanization. Such areas are found between the persistent hot spots (western parts of the district) and persistent cold spots (eastern parts of the district). Generally, the spatial pattern of the emerging hot spots followed the pattern of urbanization in the district, which had been expanding from west to east.

The presence of countless sources of groundwater pollution is therefore a matter of environmental concern. The sources of groundwater contamination can be classified into two different categories: 1) Point Sources (PS), which correspond to areas releasing plumes of high concentrations (i.e. hot-spots) and 2) Multiple-Point Sources (MPS) consisting in a series of unidentifiable small sources clustered within large areas, generating an anthropogenic diffuse contamination. The latter category frequently predominates in European Functional Urban Areas (FUA) and cannot be managed through standard remediation techniques, mainly because detecting the many different source areas releasing small contaminant mass in groundwater is unfeasible. A specific legislative action has been recently enacted at Regional level (DGR IX/3510-2012), in order to identify areas prone to anthropogenic diffuse pollution and their level of contamination. With a view to defining amanagement plan, it is necessary to find where MPS are most likely positioned. This paper describes a methodology devised to identify the areas with the highest likelihood to host potential MPS. A groundwater flow model was implemented for a pilot area located in the Milan FUA and through the PEST code, a Null-Space Monte Carlo method was applied in order to generate a suite of several hundred hydraulic conductivity field realizations, each maintaining the model in a calibrated state and each consistent with the modelers' expert-knowledge. Thereafter, the MODPATH code was applied to generate back-traced advective flowpaths for each of the models built using the conductivity field realizations. Maps were then created displaying the number of backtracked particles that crossed each model cell in each stochastic calibrated model. The result is considered to be representative of the FUAs areas with the highest likelihood to host MPS responsible for diffuse contamination. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

To do this, we used Landsat-8 images and meteorological data to retrieve quantitative data on the concentrations of particulates (PM2.5), then integrated a forest management planning inventory (FMPI), population density distribution data, meteorological data, and topographic data in a Geographic Information System database, and applied a spatial statistical analysis model to identify aggregated areas (hot spots and cold spots) of particulates in the urban area of Jinjiang city, China. A geographical detector model was used to analyze the individual and interactive influences of anthropogenic and ecological factors on PM2.5 concentrations. We found that particulate concentration hot spots are mainly distributed in urban centers and suburbs, while cold spots are mainly distributed in the suburbs and exurban region. Elevation was the dominant individual factor affecting PM2.5 concentrations, followed by dominant tree species and meteorological factors. A combination of human activities (e. g., population density, impervious surface percentage) and multiple ecological factors caused the dominant interactive effects, resulting in increased PM2.5 concentrations. Our study suggests that human activities and multiple ecological factors effect PM2.5 concentrations both individually and interactively. We conclude that in order to reveal the direct and indirect effects of human activities and multiple factors on PM2.5 concentrations in urban forests, quantification of fusion satellite data and spatial statistical methods should be conducted in urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,FINE SPATIAL SCALE;PARTICULATE MATTER;PARTICLE REMOVAL;AIR-POLLUTION;RIVER DELTA;CAPTURE;CHINA;ACCUMULATION;EXPOSURE;TREES,,

This article deals with the collective potential of VGI and remote sensing to detect peri-urbanization in the conservation zone of Mexico City. On the one hand, remote sensing identifies horizontal urban expansion, and on the other hand, VGI of ecological complaints provides data about informal settlements. This enables the combination of top-down approaches (remote sensing) and bottom-up approaches (ecological complaints). Within the analysis, we identify areas of high urbanization as well as complaint densities and bring them together in a multi-scale analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS). Furthermore, we investigate the influence of settlement patterns and main roads on the peri-urbanization process in Mexico City using OpenStreetMap. Peri-urbanization is detected especially in the transition zone between the urban and rural (conservation) area and near main roads as well as settlements.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SATELLITE IMAGERY;SETTLEMENTS;EXPANSION;POVERTY;SLUMS;Mexico,,

The urban population of Sri Lanka is expected to reach to 60% by 2030 from 14% in 2010. The rapid growth in urban population and urban areas in Sri Lanka may cause serious socioeconomic disparities, if they are not handled properly. Thus, planners in Sri Lanka are in need of information about past and future urban growth patterns to plan a better and sustainable urban future for Sri Lanka. In this paper, we analyzed the characteristics of past land use and land cover trends in Matara City of Sri Lanka from 1980 to 2010 to assess the historic urban dynamics. The land use change detection analysis based on remote sensing datasets reveal that the conversion of homestead/ garden and paddy into urban land is evident in Matara City. The historic urban trends are projected into the near future by using SLEUTH urban growth model to identify the hot spots of future urbanization and as well as the urban growth patterns in Matara City up to the basic administrative level, i.e., Grama Niladari Divisions (GND). The urban growth simulations for the year 2030 reveal that 29 GNDs out of 66 GNDs in Matara City will be totally converted into urban land. Whereas, 28 GNDs will have urban land cover from 75% to 99% by 2030. The urban growth simulations are further analyzed with respect to the proposed Matara city development plan by the Urban Development Authority (UDA) of Sri Lanka. The results show that the UDA's city development plan of Matara will soon be outpaced by rapid urbanization. Based on the calibration and validation results, the SLEUTH model proved to be a useful planning tool to understand the near future urbanization of Sri Lankan cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CELLULAR-AUTOMATON MODEL;LAND-USE CHANGE;METROPOLITAN-AREA;SAN-FRANCISCO;GIS;INTEGRATION;CLASSIFICATION;PREDICTION;SCENARIOS;EXPANSION,,

For more than a century a metallurgical industry, including a large nickel smelter, was in operation in Kristiansand City. Despite the long industrial history of the Ni smelter, elevated Ni values (contaminated 200-<1200 mg/kg) in the surface soil (0-10 cm) are only found in a radius of <1.5 km from the smelter and no samples within this zone are classified as extremely contaminated (120-<2500 mg/kg). Moderately elevated Ni-values (60-<135 mg/kg) are interpreted as natural elevated concentrations, and are ascribed to the local sulphide-bearing bands occurring within the banded gneiss that dominates the bedrock of Kristiansand. The general scarcity of easily accessible moraine and gravel in the Agder province and Kristiansand municipality has traditionally resulted in extensive reuse of urban soil, which might be reflected in some of the hot spots of PTEs in the suburban areas. None of the 300 samples collected in the area are above the Norwegian uncontaminated to moderately contaminated classification regarding Hg (1-<2 mg/kg) and Cd (1.5-<10 mg/kg). In general, the urban soil quality in Kristiansand is good and represents no hazard to human health. An exception is the residential areas close to the Ni smelter that are characterised by elevated values of As, Cu, Ni and Pb. Precaution has to be taken when old wooden houses are renovated to avoid the generation of new contamination of local soil and discharge to the Kristiansand fjord of PTEs that are in house paint.

Officers' decisions about how to handle these encounters are affected by their on-the-spot assessments of young people's proclivity for delinquency, prospects for rehabilitation, and overall moral character. And because most police-citizen interactions occur in public spaces, officers render these judgments with limited information, often falling back on racial and ethnic stereotypes. In this article, Rod Brunson and Kashea Pegram examine how police officers' decisions about which young people to watch, stop, search, and arrest contribute to historical and enduring justice system inequality.        Research confirms that officers apply their discretion highly unevenly, Brunson and Pegram write, consistently exposing youth of color to a wide range of harms. Moreover, aggressive policing strategies such as stop-and-frisk disproportionately affect youths and communities of color. In many urban areas, they say, officers are a constant, inescapable, and unwelcome presence in the lives of black and Latino adolescents-especially males, who are disproportionately stopped, searched, and killed by police.        Yet the authors find reason for optimism in efforts to improve trust in minority communities and end racially discriminatory policing through practices based on procedural justice principles-that is, whether citizens believe they're treated fairly and with respect during police encounters. Still, they acknowledge, racial disparities in policing mean that in many places, police-community relations have already suffered tremendous harm that will be extremely difficult to repair.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,AFRICAN-AMERICAN YOUTHS;COLLECTIVE EFFICACY;PROCEDURAL JUSTICE;RACIAL-DIFFERENCES;PUBLIC SUPPORT;HOT-SPOTS;PERCEPTIONS;BLACK;CITY;NEIGHBORHOODS;Adolescent,,

The two sites are only 150 km apart and are characterized by different situations: While the Kathmandu Valley is one of the regional urban ""hot spots"" for concerns related to air pollution, NCO-P is representative of the background conditions of the high Himalayas and the free troposphere. Therefore, the possible role played by emissions occurring in the planetary boundary layer (PBL) of the Kathmandu Valley in influencing the variability in SLCF/P at NCO-P was investigated. BC and O-3 concentrations at NCO-P showed a linear correlation with the modeled PBL height over the Kathmandu urban area, providing evidence that the anthropogenic emissions occurring within the Kathmandu PBL could affect the variability in BC and O-3 at NCO-P. Furthermore, when introducing an additional constraint into the analysis (viz., back-trajectories), we show that on days when air mass transport between the two measurement sites was observed (10% of the period), at least 22% and 16% of BC and O-3 variability at NCO-P can be explained by concurrent variability in SLCF/P over the Kathmandu Valley.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ATMOSPHERIC BROWN CLOUDS;BOUNDARY-LAYER DYNAMICS;TERM CLIMATE-CHANGE;AIR-QUALITY;NCO-P;TROPOSPHERIC OZONE;OPTICAL-PROPERTIES;SUMMER        MONSOON;GLOBAL-SCALE;HUMAN HEALTH;Ozone;African Continental Ancestry Group;Altitude,,

Moreover, the study was implemented to better understand the biological availability of metals downstream of CSOs as well as to identify a potential risk of CSOs for benthic or pelagic biota. Samples were taken at downstream sampling sites, which were 1, 5, 10, 20, 50 and 100 m away from the outlets of the CSOs. An upstream-located sampling site each was used as reference for the respective transect. Additionally, sediments in two retention zones, located between the CSOs and the receiving creeks were analyzed. All downstream located creek sediments showed a similar metal pattern. Metal concentrations were found to be highest within the first 20 m of the creek sediments. Elevated metal concentrations were also detected in the sediments of the retention zones. Metal accumulation in the amphipods was different at all three locations, but highest levels were always found downstreamof the sediment accumulation hot spots. This might indicate that the metals were remobilized and became available for the amphipods further downstream of the CSOs.        Although the general contamination pattern with respect to each reference site was similar, the degree of contamination was different at each location as demonstrated by anthropogenic enrichment factors. The discharge frequency as well as anthropogenic influences from upper reaches appear to be the most important factors for high metal concentrations in the sediments. Accordingly, in one case high background concentrations in combination with the CSO lead to an exceedance of the predicted effect level of Zn for aquatic organisms. Therefore, sediment contamination should be included in risk assessment when constructing CSOs to protect aquatic life. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

The observation-constrained estimate, which is several times larger than the bottom-up estimate, is influenced by the spatial representativeness error due to the mesoscale inhomogeneity of the aerosol fields and the relatively low resolution of global chemistry-transport models. Here we evaluated the spatial representativeness error for two widely used observational networks (AErosol RObotic NETwork and Global Atmosphere Watch) by downscaling the geospatial grid in a global model of BC aerosol absorption optical depth to 0.1 degrees x0.1 degrees. Comparing the models at a spatial resolution of 2 degrees x2 degrees with BC aerosol absorption at AErosol RObotic NETwork sites (which are commonly located near emission hot spots) tends to cause a global spatial representativeness error of 30%, as a positive bias for the current top-down estimate of global BC direct radiative forcing.

In the aftermath of the Flint lead crisis, there is an urgent need to assess the current state of US drinking water. However, no nationwide assessment has yet been conducted on trends in drinking water quality violations across several decades. Efforts to reduce violations are of national concern given that, in 2015, nearly 21 million people relied on community water systems that violated health-based quality standards. In this paper, we evaluate spatial and temporal patterns in health-related violations of the Safe Drinking Water Act using a panel dataset of 17,900 community water systems over the period 1982-2015. We also identify vulnerability factors of communities and water systems through probit regression. Increasing time trends and violation hot spots are detected in several states, particularly in the Southwest region. Repeat violations are prevalent in locations of violation hot spots, indicating that water systems in these regions struggle with recurring issues. In terms of vulnerability factors, we find that violation incidence in rural areas is substantially higher than in urbanized areas. Meanwhile, private ownership and purchased water source are associated with compliance. These findings indicate the types of underperforming systems that might benefit from assistance in achieving consistent compliance. We discuss why certain violations might be clustered in some regions and strategies for improving national drinking water quality.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,DETERMINANTS;DISPARITIES;Drinking,,

Cities are considered hot spots and urban populations are particularly exposed. There is therefore an urgent need to adapt urban systems and urban design to tackle this issue. While most European cities have introduced measures to reduce emissions, action is still required to reduce concentrations and exposure, and a holistic approach to urban design is badly needed.        The concept of urban resilience, defined by Holling (1987) as the ability of a city to absorb a disturbance while maintaining its functions and structures, may offer a new paradigm for tackling urban air pollution.        We propose to adapt the concept of urban resilience to outdoor air pollution. A method has been developed to assess the resilience of an urban area to outdoor air pollution. Three ""resilience capacities"" have been identified: the capacity of an urban area to decrease air pollution emissions, the capacity to decrease concentrations and the capacity to decrease exposure. The calculation is based on the analysis of urban design, defined as the pattern of buildings as well as the structural elements that define an urban area (urban morphology; transport network, services and land use). For each resilience capacity, indicators are calculated using a Geographic Information System (GIS) and a grid-based approach.        This method has been implemented in the Greater Paris are a within a 500 m grid-cell system. Greater Paris is one of the densest urban areas in Europe and experiences high air pollution levels. The proposed ""quick scan"" method helps to localize areas where specific action is needed. (C) 2017 Elsevier B.V.

This work examined the impact of surface cation density and type on sorption of NDMA on dealuminated ZSM-5 zeolites, and on microwave-induced degradation of the sorbed NDMA, as well as the non-thermal effect of microwave. NDMA sorption was found to increase with the framework Si/Al ratio of dealuminated ZSM-5 zeolites (i.e., decreasing density of surface cations), and was also influenced by the type of surface cations. Degradation of the sorbed NDMA proceeded faster with increases in the power level of microwave and in the micropores with higher densities of surface cations, which was attributed to the increases in the number and/or temperature of micro-scale ""hot spots"" formed by microwave dielectric superheating of the surface cations. The degradation rate of sorbed NDMA was also found to be inversely correlated with the hydration free energy of surface cations present in the zeolite micropores.

Investigating the temporal and spatial distribution of pollutants, emissions, and pollution transport is necessary to better understand the effect of various sources on air quality. We report on mobile differential optical absorption spectroscopy (mobile DOAS) observations of precursors SO2 and NO2 vertical columns in the NCP in the summer of 2013 (from 11 June to 7 July) in this study. The different temporal and spatial distributions of SO2 and NO2 vertical column density (VCD) over this area are characterized under various wind fields. The results show that transport from the southern NCP strongly affects air quality in Beijing, and the transport route, particularly SO2 transport on the route of Shijiazhuang-Baoding-Beijing, is identified. In addition, the major contributors to SO2 along the route of Shijiazhuang-Baoding- Beijing are elevated sources compared to low area sources for the route of Dezhou-Cangzhou-Tianjin-Beijing; this is found using the interrelated analysis between in situ and mobile DOAS observations during the measurement periods. Furthermore, the discussions on hot spots near the city of JiNan show that average observed width of polluted air mass is 11.83 and 17.23 km associated with air mass diffusion, which is approximately 60 km away from emission sources based on geometrical estimation. Finally, a reasonable agreement exists between the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and mobile DOAS observations, with a correlation coefficient (R-2) of 0.65 for NO2 VCDs. Both datasets also have a similar spatial pattern. The fitted slope of 0.55 is significantly less than unity, which can reflect the contamination of local sources, and OMI observations are needed to improve the sensitivities to the near-surface emission sources through improvements of the retrieval algorithm or the resolution of satellites.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,OPTICAL-ABSORPTION SPECTROSCOPY;OMI SATELLITE-OBSERVATIONS;MAX-DOAS;AIR-POLLUTION;JANUARY 2013;SECONDARY AEROSOL;CROSS-SECTIONS;SULFUR-DIOXIDE;HAZE POLLUTION;EASTERN CHINA;China,,

Subsequently, the most well-known indicators deployed in policy-making, the established 10% indicator and the recent Low Income High Cost (LIHC) indicator, have generated considerable discussion and critique. One facet of the debate that remains unexplored is the effect of a change in indicator upon the spatial distribution of fuel poverty. Using spatial analyses we interrogate sub-regional estimates of the two indicators in England, where the LIHC indicator was first conceived. Three principle findings are discussed, enhancing understanding of the geographic features of fuel poverty as understood by each indicator. Firstly, the reduction in fuel poor households has disproportionately affected areas with lower housing costs. Secondly, there is a higher prevalence of fuel poverty in urban areas. Finally, the condition is more spatially heterogeneous with fewer 'hot-spots' and 'cold-spots'. As a result, each indicator captures different notions of what it means to be fuel poor, representing particular vulnerabilities, losses of wellbeing and injustices. This has implications for the targeting of limited alleviation resources and for alternative national contexts where the LIHC indicator might be deployed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ENERGY EFFICIENCY;NORTHERN-IRELAND;THERMAL COMFORT;JUSTICE;UK;VULNERABILITY;PERSPECTIVE;BARRIERS;INSIGHTS;Geography;England;Poverty,,

The assessment of these emissions in urban systems requires modelling approaches that integrate the complexity of urban environments as well as the high spatial and temporal variability of contaminant emissions. ENPs are emitted to urban surface waters through a variety of point and diffuse sources, with these emissions being driven by weather, usage patterns and population density. While the potential environmental and health impacts of ENPs are still not fully understood, understanding the spatial and temporal distribution of ENPs at the local scale will help to inform risk assessment. In this paper, we propose a novel modelling approach for estimating the exposure of ENPs in surface waters of urban systems. An integrative modelling framework combining an emission and a fate model for ENPs with high spatial and temporal resolution is presented and strategies for data gathering and the handling of knowledge gaps are discussed. Our framework is capable of identifying local emission hot spots and predicting exposure across a city, while generating information on the final speciation of the emitted ENPs (nano form, aggregates and other transformation products) within the studied environmental compartments over time.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CONSUMER PRODUCTS;ENVIRONMENTAL FATE;PHARMACEUTICAL RESIDUES;SILVER        NANOPARTICLES;OXIDE NANOPARTICLES;ZINC-OXIDE;WATER;NANOMATERIALS;EXPOSURE;RELEASE,,

A series of spatial analyses are conducted to reveal the spatial differentiation of sustainable development. The results show that the comprehensive UCC has a fluctuating downward trend, and the UCC compositions of four sub-systems contribute differently. There is a large gap in UCC value among the five sub-UAs in the YREB, which indicates that the unbalanced and diverse sustainable development in UAs cannot be neglected. From a dynamic perspective, the spatial differentiation is increasingly noticeable, and the pattern of spatial clustering transforms into discrete small areas. This transformation implies that many hot spot cities have preferred coordinated cooperation within a small region rather than the whole UA in recent years.

Various alternative measures have been suggested instead. Guided by the routine activity approach, this study furthers the concept of crime risk population and its measurement across space and time. Using exceptionally comprehensive data sets on population mobility and on theft from the person in a large city in China, we select the best indicator of the risk population from the following four candidates: residential population, subway ridership, taxi ridership, and mobile phone users. Controlling for the potentially confounding effects of offender and guardian presence, we show that on both weekdays and weekends, the best indicators of risk population vary over the course of the day. In the morning, residential population outperforms other measures. In the afternoon and evening, taxi ridership and phone users are better indicators. Although the mobile phone user base forms an arguably more representative measure of ambient population, during some periods taxi ridership is superior because it provides a better indicator of outdoor (as opposed to indoor) activities. In terms of practical applications to security policy and law enforcement, these findings can help identify crime hot spots by calculating accurate crime risks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,AMBIENT POPULATION;SPATIAL-ANALYSIS;PROPERTY CRIME;URBAN-CRIME;CHINA;BURGLARY;ROBBERY;STATISTICS;PATTERNS;CONTEXT;Theft,,

Spatial variability of methane (CH4) ebullition in a tropical hypereutrophic reservoir: silted areas as a bubble hot spot. Lake Reserv Manage. 35:105114.The concentration of methane (CH4) has doubled in the atmosphere over the last 200 yr, raising the need to understand emissions of this potent greenhouse gas from inland waters. CH4 ebullition is the dominant pathway in shallow aquatic environments and is difficult to quantify due to its episodic nature and heterogeneous spatial distribution. We investigated the temporal and spatial variability of CH4 ebullition during 2013 in a shallow hypereutrophic urban reservoir, in Belo Horizonte City, Brazil. The average emission measured during summer was 780 mg CH4/m(2)/d, ranging from 1 to 3070 (n = 75). During winter, the average emission was 316 mg CH4/m(2)/d, ranging from 4 to 1253 (n = 75). A strong spatial variation (P < 0.001) was observed across the reservoir in both seasons. Several folds higher (3958% of the total) emissions were recorded at the mouth of the main tributaries, which therefore was considered to be a hot spot ebullition zone. This was expected due to its shallow area (mean depth 1.30 m) with low hydrostatic pressure and 2 to 6 C (winter and summer, respectively) higher sediment temperatures, which is aggravated by the intense siltation process resulting from insufficient management of the sewage water entering the reservoir. In this article we demonstrate the consequence of siltation as an enhancing factor for CH4 emission from the hot spots ebullition zones.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,WATER;LAKES;EMISSIONS;RELEASE;FLUX;SEDIMENT;SURFACES,,

First, we identify relevant tourist areas using GPS tracking technology and field observation techniques. Second, we discuss the role of Airbnb in the emerging touristification of widely gentrified residential neighborhoods. Third, we reflect on the urban mobility practices of cyclists and pedestrians which have the potential to foster touristification by interconnecting various tourist hotspots and accommodation locations.

The extent to which these calls are concentrated on a small number of street segments, similar to traditional crime calls for service is understudied. The purpose of this paper is to examine the concentration of mental health calls and the spatial distribution of street segments with mental health calls to provide directions for law enforcement and place-based policing.        Design/methodology/approach Using call for service data from a large city on the East coast, the current study examines whether mental health calls for service are concentrated on street segments, and tests spatial dispersion to whether these mental health hot spots are spread throughout the city or clustered in space. Finally, the authors explore the relationship between mental health calls and violent and drug calls by calculating the correlation and using a spatial point pattern test to determine if mental health calls are spatially similar to violent and drug calls.        Findings The authors found that mental health calls are concentrated on street segments; specifically 22.4 percent of calls are located on 0.5 percent of city street segments. Additionally, these street segments are fairly dispersed throughout the city. When comparing the spatial similarity of mental health calls to violent and drug calls, they are highly correlated suggesting a relationship between the calls types, but the location of mental health calls appears to be different from violet and drug calls.        Originality/value Very few studies have examined the location of mental health calls and whether they are concentrated in small areas similar to crime, but such research can provide police officers new approaches to working with people with mental health problems.

A combination of automated and expert techniques were utilised using the description of objects, addresses and even selected situations, continuously improving the location quality. With the most precisely located crime incidents, the spatial distribution of crimes was analysed utilising the method of kernel density estimation. Data from 2009 to 2011 were processed and the development and changes of crime distribution over this period were analysed. In Ostrava, 86 located crime hot spots areas were identified and divided into six categories according to annual changes in the areas. Potential urban factors influencing discovered deve-lopment were considered (i.e. number of flats, use of buildings, slot machines, bars). Mainly the number of flats and use of buildings proved to have a significant influence on the prevailing development of crime hot spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,Crime,,

The impact of such a program compared with criminal justice responses is unknown because experiments directly comparing criminal justice and public health approaches to violence prevention are infeasible with observational data. We simulated experiments to test the influence of two interventions on violence: (1) Cure Violence and (2) directed police patrol in violence hot spots.        Methods: We used an agent-based model to simulate a 5% sample of the New York City (NYC) adult population, with agents placed on a grid representing the land area of NYC, with neighborhood size and population density proportional to land area and population density in each community district. Agent behaviors were governed by parameters drawn from city data sources and published estimates.        Results: Under no intervention, 3.87% (95% CI, 3.84, 3.90) of agents were victimized per year. Implementing the violence interrupter intervention for 10 years decreased victimization by 13% (to 3.35% [3.32, 3.39]). Implementing hot-spots policing and doubling the police force for 10 years reduced annual victimization by about 11% (to 3.46% [3.42, 3.49]). Increasing the police force by 40% combined with implementing the violence interrupter intervention for 10 years decreased violence by 19% (to 3.13% [3.09, 3.16]).        Conclusions: Combined investment in a public health, community-based approach to violence prevention and a criminal justice approach focused on deterrence can achieve more to reduce population-level rates of urban violence than either can in isolation.

In this study, we used three of these different methodologies applied to the Campanian Plain located in southern Italy: SINTACS, AVI and LOS. However, their capability to describe the observed chemical pollution of the area has resulted quite poor. For such a reason, a modified SINTACS method has been then implemented in the area in order to get a more reliable view of groundwater vulnerability. NO3- and SO42- from more than 400 monitoring wells were used for specific vulnerability assessment. Land use was chosen as key parameter to infer the risk of groundwater pollution in our area. The new methodology seems to show a higher correlation with observed NO3- concentrations and a more reliable identification of aquifer's pollution hot spots. The main sources of NO3- were found in sub-urban areas, where vulnerability and risk are higher than in other areas. Otherwise due to reducing conditions triggered by the presence of elevated sedimentary organic matter and peat, concentrations below agricultural areas were lower than in sub-urban areas. The SO42- specific vulnerability map showed a positive correlation with observed concentrations, due to geogenic and anthropogenic SO42- sources present in the area. The combination of both NO3- and SO42- derived risk maps becomes essential to improve the conceptual model of aquifer pollution in this severely anthropized area. The application of this new and original approach shed light on the strengths and weaknesses of each of the described previous methods and clearly showed how anthropogenic activities have to be taken into account in the assessment process.

In this paper, we analyze MI hospitalizations in Calgary from 2004 to 2013, stratified by age and gender. First, a seasonal trend decomposition analyzes the seasonality; then a linear regression models the trend component. Moran's I and hot spot analyses explore the spatial pattern. Though exploratory, results show that most age and gender groups feature a statistically significant decline over the 10 years, consistentwith previous studies in Canada. Decline rates vary across ages and genders, with the slowest decline observed for younger males. Each gender exhibits a seasonal pattern with peaks in both winter and summer. Spatially, MI hot spots are identified in older communities, and in socioeconomically and environmentally disadvantaged communities. In the older communities, higher MI rates appear to be more highly associated with demographics. Conversely, worse air quality appears to be locally associated with higher MI incidence in younger age groups. The study helps identify areas of concern, where MI hot spots are identified for younger age groups, suggesting the need for localized public health policies to target local risk factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,HEART-DISEASE MORTALITY;SEASONAL-VARIATION;AIR-POLLUTION;METEOROLOGICAL PARAMETERS;TRENDS;ASSOCIATION;HEALTH;WEATHER;TEMPERATURE;VARIABILITY;Canada;Myocardial Infarction,,

In this study, a combination of passive sampling and Geographical Information System-based geo-statistics are used with spatial statistics of autocorrelation to characterise the spatial pattern of the quality of air based on concentrations of these pollutants in Yalova. The spatial temporal variations of pollutants in the air with five types of land-use, residence, rural, highway, side road and industrial areas were investigated at 40 stations in Yalova between 7th August 2015 and 26th August 2015 using passive sampling. An inverse distance weighting interpolation technique was used to estimate variables at an unmeasured location from observed values at nearby locations. The spatial autocorrelation of air pollutants in the city was investigated using the statistical methods of Moran's I in addition to the Getis Ord Gi. During the summer, highway and industrial sites had higher levels of BTEX then rural areas. The average concentration of toluene was measured to be 5.83 mu g/m(3) and this is the highest pollutant concentration. Average concentrations of NO2, O-3 and SO2 are 35.64, 84.23 and 3.95 mu g/m(3), respectively. According to the global results of Moran's I; NO2 and BTEX had positive correlations on a global space at a significant rate.

Heavy metals deposited (build-up) on urban road surface can enter road stormwater runoff, undermining stormwater reuse safety. As heavy metal build-up loads perform high variabilities in terms of spatial distribution and is strongly influenced by surrounding land uses, it is essential to develop an approach to identify hot-spots where stormwater runoff could include high heavy metal concentrations and hence cannot be reused if it is not properly treated. This study developed a robust modelling approach to estimating heavy metal build-up loads on urban roads using land use fractions (representing percentages of land uses within a given area) by an artificial neural network (ANN) model technique. Based on the modelling results, a series of heavy metal load spatial distribution maps and a comprehensive ecological risk map were generated. These maps provided a visualization platform to identify priority areas where the stormwater can be safely reused. Additionally, these maps can be utilized as an urban land use planning tool in the context of effective stormwater reuse strategy implementation. (C) 2017 Elsevier Ltd.

This societal change is a consequence of a national drive toward economic prosperity. However, accelerated urban development resulting from rapid population migration from rural to urban lands has led to high levels of untreated sewage entering aquatic ecosystems directly. Consequently, many of these regions have been identified as hot spots of riverine nitrogen (N) pollution because of the increasing level of urban point-source discharge. In order to address this concern, we assessed effects of urban development on ammonia-nitrogen (AN) loads using a panel data regression model. The model, expressed as an exponential function of anthropogenic N inputs multiplied by a power function of streamflow, was applied to 20 subwatersheds of the Huai River Basin for the years 2003-2010. The results indicated that this model can account for 81% of the variation in annual AN fluxes over space and time. Application of this model to three scenarios of urban development and sewage treatment (termed urbanization priority, sustainable development, and environmental priority) suggests that future N pollution will inevitably deteriorate if current urban environmental management and investment are not significantly improved. Stronger support for environmental management is very critical to alleviate N pollution and improve water quality. More effort should focus on improving sewage treatment and the N removal rate of the current sewage system in light of the increasing degree of urbanization.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-USE CHANGE;ANTHROPOGENIC NITROGEN;REGIONAL NITROGEN;EXPORT        DYNAMICS;WATER-QUALITY;CHINA;INPUTS;BASIN;FLUXES;URBANIZATION;Urban Population;Ammonia;Nitrogen,,

Methods: This was a retrospective analysis of TF outbreaks in 2011 in Kikwit, DRC using microbiological analysis of water sources and a structured interview questionnaire. Results: There were a total of 1430 reported TF cases. The outbreak's epidemic curve shows earliest and highest peak attack rates (AR) in three military camps located in Kikwit (Ebeya 3.2%; Ngubu 3.0%; and Nsinga 2.2%) compared to an average peak AR of 0.6% in other affected areas. A total 320 cases from the military camps and the high burden health areas were interviewed. Typhoid cases in the military camps shared a latrine with more than one family (P<0.02). All tap water sources in both the military camps and general population were found to be highly contaminated with faecal coliforms. Conclusion: The role of military camps in Kikwit as early hotspots of TF transmission was likely associated with lower sanitary and hygiene conditions. The proximity of camps to the general population might have been responsible for disseminating TF to the general population. Mapping of cases during an outbreak could be crucial to identify hot spots for transmission and institute corrective measures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,RISK-FACTORS;PARATYPHOID FEVER;Q Fever;Disease Outbreaks;Fever,,

Considering 1991-2010 as the baseline reference period, FORE-SCE projections of year 2091 under three scenarios (A1B, A2, and B1 from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) are separately assimilated into the calibrated model, whereas climate input is kept the same as in the baseline. Modeling results suggest an increase of 0.5% and 3.5% in the average annual streamflow at the basin outlet (Grafton, Illinois) during 2081-2100, respectively, for A1B and A2, whereas for B1, streamflow would decrease by 1.5%. Under the ""worst case"" A2 scenario, 6% and 133% increase, respectively, in agricultural and urban areas with 30% depletion of forest and grassland would result into 70% increase in surface runoff, 20% decrease in soil moisture, and 4% decrease in evapotranspiration in certain parts of the basin. Conversion of cropland, forest, or grassland to perennial hay/pasture areas would lower surface runoff by 25% especially in the central region, whereas persistent forest cover in the northern region would cause up to 7% increase in evapotranspiration. The ecosystem in the lower half of UMRB is likely to become adverse, as dictated by a composite water-energy balance indicator. Future land use change extents and resultant hydrologic responses are found significantly different under A2, A1B, and B1 scenarios, which resonates the need for multi-scenario ensemble assessments towards characterizing a probable future.

A subset of the literature has focused on how micro-level spatial factors influence the formation of crime hot spots. At the same time, tangential research has highlighted how neighbourhood disadvantage influences crime occurrence. The current study focuses on the intersection of these perspectives through a spatial analysis of Motor Vehicle Theft (MVT) and Motor Vehicle Recovery (MVR) in Colorado Springs, CO. We begin by conducting a Risk Terrain Modelling analysis to identify spatial risk factors significantly related to MVT and MVR occurrence. We then test whether the spatial influences of the criminogenic risk factors differ across traditional measures of neighbourhood disadvantage. Findings suggest that while a citywide effect is evident for multiple risk factors, their spatial influence on crime significantly varies across neighbourhood contexts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,SOCIAL-DISORGANIZATION;COLLECTIVE EFFICACY;CRIMINOLOGICAL THEORY;ROUTINE ACTIVITY;HOMICIDE TRENDS;CRIME ANALYSIS;VIOLENT CRIME;AUTO        THEFT;HOT-SPOTS;RISK;Theft,,

As such, they are particularly vulnerable to global warming and associated increases in extreme temperatures. Yet ensemble climate-model projections are generally performed on a scale that is too coarse to represent the evolution of temperatures in cities. Here, for the first time, we combine unprecedented long-term (35years) urban climate model integrations at the convection-permitting scale (2.8km resolution) with information from an ensemble of general circulation models to assess temperature-based heat stress for Belgium, a densely populated midlatitude maritime region. We discover that the heat stress increase toward the mid-21st century is twice as large in cities compared to their surrounding rural areas. The exacerbation is driven by the urban heat island itself, its concurrence with heat waves, and urban expansion. Cities experience a heat stress multiplication by a factor 1.4 and 15 depending on the scenario. Remarkably, the future heat stress surpasses everywhere the urban hot spots of today. Our results demonstrate the need to combine information from climate models, acting on different scales, for climate change risk assessment in heterogeneous regions.

We used three environmental factors-the building year (i.e., the year of construction) of houses, the town taxable value of houses, and the soil lead concentration-averaged at the census block level to explore the spatially varying relationships between children's lead poisoning and environmental factors. The results indicated that GWPR not only produced better model fitting and reduced the spatial dependence and heterogeneity in the model residuals but also improved the model predictions for the spatial clusters, or hot spots, of children's lead poisoning across inner city neighborhoods. Furthermore, the spatially varying model coefficients and their associated statistical tests were visualized using geographical information system maps to show the high-risk areas for the impacts of the environmental factors on the response variable.

CRIMED is a spatial risk index, which combines variables (multiple data layers) representing different aspects of risk in such a way that coastal areas of relatively higher risk emerge from the integration of the variables. It creates an interface between theoretical concepts of risk and the decision-making process relating to disaster risk reduction. Based on a GIS application, CRI-MED provides relative hazard, exposure, vulnerability and risk maps of the Mediterranean region that allow researchers and policy-makers to identify coastal areas most at risk from coastal erosion and coastal flooding, the so-called ""hot-spots"". Through the application of CRI-MED on 21 Mediterranean countries, coastal hot-spots are found to be predominantly located in the south-eastern Mediterranean region. Countries with the highest percentage of extremely high risk values are Syria (30.5%), Lebanon (22.1%), Egypt (20.7%), and Palestine (13.7%). The CRI-MED method is intended as a scientific tool which produces easily understandable outcomes, to support international organizations and national governments to enhance and mainstream decision-making based on information that is accessible and useful. The definition of coastal hot-spots aims to support the prioritization of policies and resources for adaptation and Integrated Coastal Zone Management (ICZM). In particular, the resulting risk maps enable identification of suitable and less suitable areas for urban settlements, infrastructures and economic activities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SEA-LEVEL RISE;VULNERABILITY INDEX;STORM SURGES;HAZARDS;VARIABILITY;Mediterranean Region,,

Nevertheless, the implementation of the programmes outlined in Malaysian Road Safety Plan 2006 needs to be enhanced in order to achieve the set targets. In this regard, it is imperative for all parties concerning road safety to determine the factors that significantly contribute to road traffic deaths. According to the Ministry of Works, Malaysia, the blackspot treatment programme (which is centred on the elimination of road hazards by engineering approaches) is successful in reducing the number of injuries due to road traffic accidents up to a certain extent. This study is focussed on analysing road traffic deaths caused by various road environment elements recorded by the police from 2000 to 2011 in order to determine their distribution, proportion and relationship with fatal accidents. The Chi-square test and Marascuilo procedure with 5% level of significance are used in this study. Based on locality, the number of road traffic deaths in rural area (66%) is significantly higher compared with that in urban areas (34%). Based on road category, the number of road traffic deaths is the highest for federal roads, whereas the highest rate of fatalities per kilometre is recorded for expressways. Based on road segment, the number of road traffic deaths is the highest for straight road segments, followed by bends. In addition, the number of road traffic deaths is the highest for Y/T junctions, followed by cross junctions. The lowest number of road traffic deaths is recorded for interchanges and roundabouts. The results show that only 11.25% of the total road traffic deaths are related to road defects. The highest proportion of deaths due to road defects (48.6%) is associated with lack of street lighting provision, whereas road shoulder edge drop-off and potholes contribute 15.4% and 11.2% of road traffic deaths, respectively.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,MORTALITY;CRASHES;SAFETY;SPEED;Malaysia,,

The number of days with high T (mrt) in Gothenburg was relatively unchanged at the end of the century (+1 day), whereas it more than doubled in Frankfurt and tripled in Porto. The use of street trees to reduce daytime radiant heat load was analyzed using hot spots to identify where trees could be most beneficial. Hot spots, although varying in intensity and frequency, were generally confined to near sunlit southeast-southwest facing walls, in northeast corner of courtyards, and in open spaces in all three cities. By adding trees in these spaces, the radiant heat load can be reduced, especially in spaces with no or few trees.

Therefore, a complementary effect-based risk assessment by bioanalyses on mixtures of bioavailable micropollutants is proposed: the Smart Integrated Monitoring (SIMONI) strategy. The goal of this strategy is to obtain more reliable information on the water quality to select optimum measures for improvement. The SIMONI strategy is 2-tiered. Tier 1 is a bioanalytical hazard identification of sites. A tier 2 ecological risk assessment is carried out only at a limited number of sites where increased hazards are detected in tier 1. Tier 2 will be customized, based on tier 1 evaluation and additional knowledge of the aquatic system. The present study focuses on the tier 1 bioanalytical hazard identification to distinguish ""hot spots"" of chemical pollution. First, a selection was made of relevant and cost-effective bioanalytical endpoints to cover a wide spectrum of micropollutant modes of action. Specific endpoints may indicate which classes of chemicals might cause adverse effects. Second, effect-based trigger values (EBT) were derived for these bioassays to indicate potential ecological risks. Comparison of EBT with bioassay responses should discriminate sites exhibiting different chemical hazards. Third, a model was designed to estimate the overall risks for aquatic ecosystems. The associated follow-up for risk management is a ""toxicity traffic light"" system: green, low hazard (no action required); orange, potential risk (further research needed); and red, high risk (mitigation measures). Thanks to cost-effectiveness, flexibility, and relevance, the SIMONI strategy has the potential to become the first bioanalytical tool to be applied in regular water quality monitoring programs.

Seasonal denitrification enzyme activity (DEA) was compared in stream-riparian ecotones of four streams with varying hydrologic connection, riparian vegetation composition, and agricultural influence. Riparian and stream DEA was generally higher in sites adjacent to agricultural fields due to proximity to nitrate source. Mean DEA was higher in the dormant season (riparian: 928 +/- 116 ng N g(-1) dry mass [DM] h(-1), stream: 108 +/- 149 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) than in the growing season (riparian: 355 +/- 55 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1), stream: 45 +/- 40 ng N g(-1) DM h(-1)) and was influenced by antecedent precipitation, soil texture, and landscape characteristics (land use, vegetation type, topography) in multivariate models. Hot spots of denitrification occurred at the confluence of fine soil textures with high organic matter and moisture, often at low-lying areas of the landscape. At the restored site, we observed enhanced denitrification in the reconnected floodplain but decreased stream denitrification capacity in pools. Across all sites, streams had lower DEA than riparian zones, stressing the importance of restoration approaches designed to conserve riparian areas and maintain hydrologic connectivity. Easily obtainable data including precipitation, adjacent land use, vegetation, and stream and floodplain geomorphology reasonably predicted denitrification potential compared with more complex models, showing potential for application in water resources and nitrogen management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-USE;SEASONAL-VARIATION;RESTORATION;NITRATE;URBAN;NITROGEN;ZONE;CARBON;PHOSPHORUS;PATTERNS;Denitrification,,

We use group-based trajectory analysis to examine trends in recorded crime incidents on street segments in Brooklyn Park, a suburban city outside Minneapolis, Minnesota, over a 15-year period from 2000 to 2014.        Consistent with the law of crime concentration at place, crime in Brooklyn Park is highly concentrated at a small percentage of micro-places. Two percent of street segments produced 50 % of the crime over the study period and 0.4 % of segments produced 25 % of the crime. The patterns of concentration are highly stable over time. However, the concentration of crime is substantially higher and there is much less street-by-street variability in Brooklyn Park compared to urban areas.        We find strong support for the application of the law of crime concentration at place to a non-urban setting, suggesting that place-based policing approaches tested in cities can also be applied to suburbs. However, there are also important differences in the concentration and variability of crime hot spots in suburbs that require further examination.

Here, we analysed the spatiotemporal variability in CWT over the course of a year (2013) using 5760 measurements from 1255 urban water system sampling locations across the Yarra Valley Water region in Melbourne, Australia. CWT varied across the study site from 12-28 degrees C during summer and 9-15 degrees C during winter. Spatial clusters of higher CWT regions (hot spots) and lower CWT regions (cold spots) were also observed. The CWT variability impact on annual household WRE demand was estimated to be between 17 to +19% (-640 to +680 kWh/hh.yr) change in water heating for sample households, which is dependent on the geographical location of the household within the study site. However, households located in cold spot regions will have almost twice the amount of WRE demand than average, conversely, WRE demand will be lower than average in hot spot regions.        Monthly mean CWTs diverged from the Australian Standards for hot water system energy consumption guidelines value by 21 to +47%. The magnitude of CWT variability and associated energy required for water heating are comparable with the total energy used by water utilities to deliver water supply and sewage disposal services. Variation in water heating could be as large as -4.6 kWh/hh.d (hot spot in March) and 3.6 kWh/hh.d (cold spot in July), more than three times the total energy used to deliver water supply and sewage disposal services for this region.

The Cuiaba River transects the Cerrado biome prior to inundating large areas of the Pantanal, creating one of the largest biodiversity hot spots in the world. We measured dissolved organic carbon (DOC) and the optical absorbance and fluorescence properties of dissolved organic matter (DOM) from 40 sampling locations spanning Cerrado and Pantanal biomes during wet and dry seasons. In the upper, more agricultural region of the basin, DOC concentrations were highest in the rainy season with more aromatic and humified DOM. In contrast, DOC concentrations and DOM optical properties were more uniform for the more urbanized middle region of the basin between wet and dry seasons, as well as across sample locations. In the lower region of the basin, wet season connectivity between the river and the Pantanal floodplain led to high DOC concentrations, a fourfold increase in humification index (HIX) (an indicator of DOM humification), and a 50% reduction in the spectral slope (S-R). Basin-wide, wet season values for S-R, HIX, and FI (fluorescence index) indicated an increasing representation of terrestrially derived DOM that was more humified. Parallel factor analysis identified two terrestrially derived components (C1 and C2) representing 77% of total fluorescing DOM (fDOM). A third, protein-like fDOM component increased markedly during the wet season within the more urban-impacted region.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER;PARALLEL FACTOR-ANALYSIS;FLUORESCENCE        SPECTROSCOPY;LAND-USE;CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION;OKAVANGO DELTA;WATER-QUALITY;AMAZON BASIN;HUMIC ACIDS;MATO-GROSSO,,

A social vulnerability assessment trial was carried out for Chinese coastal cities at the county level. First, the 10 factors having the most influence on social vulnerability were identified. They are ""House with no lavatory"", ""House with no bath facilities"", ""Employees in primary industry"", ""Houses with no tap water"", ""GDP in primary sector"", ""Children"", ""House with no kitchen"", ""Rate of natural increase (RNI), ""Employees in management sector"", and ""Highly educated"". Second, indexes of social vulnerability, exposure, sensitivity, and adaptability were evaluated and mapped to examine their spatial pattern. The results demonstrate that the distribution of exposure index (EI) is similar to that of social vulnerability index (SVI): many counties are categorized at the medium level while a few counties belong to the high or low categories. The distribution of adaptability proves that it should be paid more attention, as 30.14% of its counties belong to the lowest level. After calculating the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic of SVI, two cold spots and two hot spots are identified. Third, the relationship between urban development and social vulnerability are discussed. During urbanization, there are evident differences of SVI between urban and rural areas. Urbanization can help city districts reduce social vulnerability, while creating more social vulnerability in the coastal counties. For the districts, more adjustment strategies and work should be applied in the dimension of exposure during urbanization. For the counties, the prominent problem to be faced is an increase in sensitivity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,YANGTZE-RIVER DELTA;NATURAL HAZARDS;FLOOD VULNERABILITY;ADAPTATION;ECOSYSTEM;LIVELIHOOD;HOUSEHOLDS;FRAMEWORK;CHINA;VARIABILITY,,

This study provides a systematic approach that combines remote sensing and cadastral data to distinguish different forms of vacant land for the Phoenix, Arizona metropolitan area while reducing computation time. The approach identifies vacant parcels for potential greening, focusing on privately owned land lacking buildings and impervious surfaces. The results for the Phoenix area reveal hot spots of these parcels, many of which reside along the fringe of the metropolis awaiting development.

A synthesis of peer-reviewed literature from 2010 to date and own modeling work on biophysical impacts of climate change on selected sectors shows that the region is highly affected by present and future climate change. These biophysical impacts paired with other pressures and a lack of resilience in some countries cause high vulnerabilities within these sectors and for social dimensions in the MENA region. The agricultural sector, of which 70 percent is rain-fed, is highly exposed to changing climatic conditions. This is of critical importance as the agriculture sector is the largest employer in many Arab countries and contributes significantly to national economies. Impacts will be high in a 2 A degrees C world, as, e.g., annual water discharge, already critically low, is projected to drop by another 15-45% (75% in a 4 A degrees C world) and unusual heat extremes projected to affect about one-third of the land area with likely consequences for local food production. As a consequence, deteriorating rural livelihoods associated with declining agricultural productivity will continue to contribute to migration flows, often to urban areas as already observed. The region could be heavily challenged by both rising food and water demand given its projected increase in population that may double by 2070. As a result, the regions already substantial import dependency could increase and thus its vulnerability to agricultural impacts well beyond its country borders. A severe and sustained pressure on resources could contribute to further social unrest in the already unstable political environment that currently characterizes parts of the region. While the particular societal responses to such changes are hard to foresee, it is clear that extreme impacts would constitute unprecedented challenges to the social systems affected.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SEA-LEVEL-RISE;DEVELOPING-COUNTRIES;MIGRATION;ADAPTATION;DROUGHT;TRENDS;TEMPERATURE;EXTREMES;LEISHMANIASIS;PRECIPITATION,,

Human beings may be directly exposed to heavy metals in soils through the inhalation of soil particles, dermal contact, and oral ingestion, which can seriously threaten health. This study assesses the health risks associated with heavy metals in soils by determining the concentrations of eight heavy metals (Cr, Pb, Cd, Hg, As, Cu, Zn, and Ni) based on 2051 surface-soil samples collected from the southern Yangtze River Delta of China. The mean concentrations were higher than the corresponding background values in Zhejiang Province and China as a whole, indicating an accumulation of heavy metals. The health risk assessment suggests that the non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risks in the study area were not significant. The non-carcinogenic risk for children was the highest, followed by those for adults and seniors; the non-carcinogenic risk for the entire population was less than 1.0, the predetermined threshold. Carcinogenic risk for adults was the highest, followed by those for seniors and children; a few sample points had a value larger than the threshold of 1.0E-04. Arsenic represented the greatest contribution to non-carcinogenic and carcinogenic risk. Meanwhile, ingestion of heavy metals in soil was the main exposure pathway for carcinogenic risk, followed by inhalation and dermal exposure. The spatial method of Getis-Ord was used to identify hot spots of health risk. Hot spots with high hazard index (HI) and total carcinogenic risk (TCR) for children, adults, and seniors were mainly distributed in core urban areas, such as Jiangbei, Haishu, Yinzhou, Jiangdong, and the urban areas of some other counties, which coincided with industrial, mining, and urban areas of the study area and were strongly influenced by anthropogenic activities. These results provide a basis for heavy metal control in soil, source identification, and environment management in the Yangtze River Delta and other rapidly developing industrial regions in China.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"SPATIAL-DISTRIBUTION;GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSES;AGRICULTURAL SOILS;POLLUTION;CHINA;CITY;ACCUMULATION;MULTIVARIATE;PROVINCE;CADMIUM;Metals, Heavy",,

Using a new data set of nearly 1200 groundwater quality samples throughout Pakistan, we have created state-of-the-art hazard and risk maps of arsenic-contaminated groundwater for thresholds of 10 and 50 mg/liter. Logistic regression analysis was used with 1000 iterations, where surface slope, geology, and soil parameters were major predictor variables. The hazard model indicates that much of the Indus Plain is likely to have elevated arsenic concentrations, although the rest of the country is mostly safe. Unlike other arsenic-contaminated areas of Asia, the arsenic release process in the arid Indus Plain appears to be dominated by elevated-pH dissolution, resulting from alkaline topsoil and extensive irrigation of unconfined aquifers, although pockets of reductive dissolution are also present. We estimate that approximately 50 million to 60 million people use groundwater within the area at risk, with hot spots around Lahore and Hyderabad. This number is alarmingly high and demonstrates the urgent need for verification and testing of all drinking water wells in the Indus Plain, followed by appropriate mitigation measures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,DRINKING-WATER;HEALTH-RISKS;GROUND-WATER;WEST-BENGAL;NEW-ENGLAND;EXPOSURE;BANGLADESH;VIETNAM;AREA;MECHANISMS;Hydrogen-Ion Concentration;Arsenic,,

We show that these trends and step change years coincide with the effective date and period of the national strategy for energy development and relocation in northwestern China and the regulations in the reduction of SO2 emissions. Under the national regulations for the reduction of SO2 emissions in eastern and southern China, SO2 VCD in the Pearl River Delta (PRD) of southern China exhibited the largest decline during 2005-2015 at a rate of -7% yr(-1)), followed by the North China Plain (NCP) (-6.7% yr(-1)), Sichuan Basin (-6.3% yr(-1)), and Yangtze River Delta (YRD) (-6% yr(-1)). The Mann-Kendall (MK) test reveals the step change points of declining SO2 VCD in 2009 for the PRD and 2012-2013 for eastern China responding to the implementation of SO2 control regulation in these regions. In contrast, the MK test and regression analysis also revealed increasing trends of SO2 VCD in northwestern China, particularly for several ""hot spots"" featured by growing SO2 VCD in those large-scale energy industry bases in northwestern China. The enhanced SO2 VCD is potentially attributable to increasing SO2 emissions due to the development of large-scale energy industry bases in energy-abundant northwestern China under the national strategy for the energy safety of China in the 21st century. We show that these largescale energy industry bases could overwhelm the trends and changes in provincial total SO2 emissions in northwestern China and contribute increasingly to the national total SO2 emissions in China. Given that northwestern China is more ecologically fragile and uniquely susceptible to atmospheric pollution than the rest of China, increasing SO2 emissions in this part of China should not be overlooked and merit scientific research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SULFUR-DIOXIDE EMISSIONS;SHELTER FOREST;MANN-KENDALL;OZONE;TRENDS;INVENTORY;POLLUTION;AIR;POLLUTANTS;RETRIEVAL;China,,

The first urban record of Lu. longipalpis in Argentina was from the City of Clorinda in 2004. The aim of this study was to analyse the monthly distribution and abundance of Lu. longipalpis and to evaluate its association with environmental and climatic variables in Clorinda City, Province of Formosa.        Methods: Phlebotominae sampling was performed using CDC light mini-traps that were placed in different sites of the city between January 2012 and December 2013. Environmental variables including the normalised difference vegetation index, normalized difference water index, land surface temperature and precipitation were evaluated using a spatiotemporal model.        Results: A total of 4996 phlebotomine sandflies were captured during the study period, and eight species were reported: Lu. longipalpis, Migonemyia migonei, Nyssomyia whitmani, Ny. neivai, Brumptomyia guimaraesi, Evandromyia cortelezzii/sallesi, Psathyromyia bigeniculata and Expapillata firmatoi. This is the first urban record of Ex. firmatoi in Argentina. Lutzomyia longipalpis was the most abundant species between 2012 and 2013, and it appeared in all the sampled sites. Moreover, the model applied showed that ground humidity and temperature were significantly associated with the abundance of Lu. longipalpis.        Conclusions: This longitudinal approach at city scale allows for modelling that explains more than 60% of the temporal variability of the abundance of Lu. longipalpis based exclusively on satellite obtained data. The results support the hypothesis of steady ` hot spots' of abundance with time, while other sites could change its abundance due to eventual microenvironment changes. The Lu. longipalpis abundance driving factors are breeding site-related variables, highlighting the importance both for modelling and surveillance to use lag data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-SURFACE TEMPERATURE;VISCERAL LEISHMANIASIS TRANSMISSION;DIFFERENCE WATER INDEX;MATO-GROSSO;NORTHEASTERN ARGENTINA;URBAN AREA;MODELS;BRAZIL;STATE;EMISSIVITY;Argentina;Taiwan,,

This study aims to map and explore the spatial variation and hot-spots of district level diarrhea incidences in Ghana.        Methods: Data on district level incidences of diarrhea from 2010 to 2014 were compiled together with population data. We mapped the relative risks using empirical Bayesian smoothing. The spatial scan statistics was used to detect and map spatial and space-time clusters. Logistic regression was used to explore the relationship between space-time clustering and urbanization strata, i.e. rural, peri-urban, and urban districts.        Results: We observed substantial variation in the spatial distribution of the relative risk. There was evidence of significant spatial clusters with most of the excess incidences being long-term with only a few being emerging clusters. Space-time clustering was found to be more likely to occur in peri-urban districts than in rural and urban districts.        Conclusion: This study has revealed that the excess incidences of diarrhea is spatially clustered with peri-urban districts showing the greatest risk of space-time clustering. More attention should therefore be paid to diarrhea in peri-urban districts.

Methods: Moran's I was applied to first examine the spatial cluster of dengue fever in Guangzhou. Nine socio-ecological factors were chosen to represent the urbanization level, economy, accessibility, environment, and the weather of the 167 townships/streets in Guangzhou, and then the geographical detector was applied to analyze the individual and interactive effects of these factors on the dengue outbreak. Results: Four clusters of dengue fever were identified in Guangzhou in 2014, including one hot spot in the central area of Guangzhou and three cold spots in the suburban districts. For individual effects, the temperature (q = 0.33) was the dominant factor of dengue fever, followed by precipitation (q = 0.24), road density (q = 0.24), and water body area (q = 0.23). For the interactive effects, the combination of high precipitation, high temperature, and high road density might result in increased dengue fever incidence.

Although a number of studies on direct displacement have been carried out, insights into the mechanisms underlying indirect displacement are lacking. The present research investigated property-led redevelopment in Shenzhen and the induced chain effects of price-shadowing and indirect residential displacement. It was found that property-led urban redevelopment exhibits strong effects of price shadowing on adjacent housing prices by creating property hot spots and bringing about changes in the housing market. A multilevel hedonic model quantitatively confirmed the price-shadowing effect of urban redevelopment, by showing that perceived or actual redevelopment increases housing prices in the vicinity. Interviews with residents of neighbourhoods adjacent to three typical redevelopment projects revealed that redevelopment induced indirect displacement is closely related to rising property values and that residents suffer from both exclusionary displacement and displacement pressure. Residential displacement in China has gone beyond forced eviction and has taken on more indirect and latent forms. Property-led urban redevelopment is a key catalyst for this.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,NEW-BUILD GENTRIFICATION;RESIDENTIAL-MOBILITY;CHINESE CITIES;URBAN;NEIGHBORHOOD;LONDON;CITY;VILLAGES;STATE;CHENGZHONGCUN,,

The perceptions urban areas trigger and how these cause behavioural changes reflect the implications of planning and decision-making upon them. Prior studies indicate that environmental factors can trigger affective reactions in people. Thus, throughout this study, it was attempted to understand how environmental factors affect University students' perceptions of safety, which were quantified on the basis of their arousal, i.e. the calmness or stress felt, and walking speeds. Data on arousal were captured in real-time by a technically-sound, low-cost device assembled using free and open source software and hardware. The study could demarcate and rank the areas perceived to be ""safe"" and ""unsafe"" by the University students in real-time using the assembled device and identify which environmental factors have the most significant influence on their perception of safety. This study introduces the chance to determine unconscious reactions of people by triangulating data gathered by several measurement techniques that are directly measured in the field, which can be served as useful inputs for urban planning.

However, little is known about CO2 and CH4 dynamics in lowland coastal rivers profoundly modified by anthropogenic perturbations. Here we report results from a long-term, large-scale study of CO2 and CH4 partial pressures (pCO(2) and pCH(4)) and evasion rates in the Shanghai river network. The spatiotemporal variabilities of pCO(2) and pCH(4) were examined along a land use gradient, and the annual CO2 and CH4 evasion were estimated to assess its role in regional C budget. During the study period (August 2009 to October 2011), the overall mean pCO(2) and median pCH(4) from 87 surveyed rivers were 58462773atm and 241atm, respectively. Internal metabolic CO2 production and dissolved inorganic carbon input via upstream runoff were the major sources sustaining the widespread CO2 supersaturation, coupling pCO(2) to biogeochemical and hydrological controls, respectively. While CH4 was oversaturated throughout the river network, CH4 hot spots were concentrated in the small urban rivers and highly discharge-dependent. The Shanghai river network played a disproportionately important role in regional C budget, offsetting up to 40% of the regional terrestrial net ecosystem production and 10% of net C uptake in the river-dominated East China Sea fueled by anthropogenic nutrient input. Given the rapid urbanization in global coastal areas, more research is needed to quantify the role of lowland coastal rivers as a major landscape C source in global C budget.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-MATTER;CHANGJIANG YANGTZE-RIVER;LAND-USE;AMAZONIAN        RIVERS;FLUVIAL NETWORK;SURFACE WATERS;CH4 FLUXES;CO2;EMISSIONS;STREAM;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Carbon Dioxide;China,,

Crime displacement refers to the relocation of criminal events as a result of policing efforts. If this phenomenon is neglected, the near-repeat analysis will tend not to obtain the overall spatial distribution pattern of criminal cases, leading to limited effectiveness of crime control. This paper presents a non-homogeneous diffusion model where crime spreads not only to spatially and temporally adjacent areas, but also to areas with similar environmental characteristics.

We examine these differences among urban and rural households that are part of the REACCTING study in Northern Ghana. While urban and rural populations in the study area all use multiple stoves, the types of stoves and fuels differ, with urban participants more likely to use charcoal and LPG while rural households rely primarily on wood. Further, rural and urban households tend to use different stoves/fuels to cook the same dishes-for example, the staple porridge Tuo Zaafi (TZ) is primarily cooked over wood fires in rural areas and charcoal stoves in urban settings. This suggests that fuel availability and ability to purchase fuel may be a stronger predictor of fuel choice than cultural preferences alone. Ambient concentrations of air pollutants also differ in these two types of areas, with urban areas having pollutant hot spots to which residents can be exposed and rural areas having more homogeneous and lower pollutant concentrations. Further, exposures to carbon monoxide and particulate matter differ in magnitude and in timing between urban and rural study participants, suggesting different behaviors and sources of exposures. The results from this analysis highlight important disparities between urban and rural populations of a single region and imply that such a characterization is needed to successfully implement and assess the impacts of household energy interventions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,PM2.5;Ghana,,

A 50-m resolution grid is used to capture urban development factors and the climate data based on 1 year of mobile and fix-point measurements, from which the thermal load and the wind environment map are constructed. The results herein reveal that a higher urban development level is associated with a higher thermal load, and similar areas are more likely than others to suffer from an extreme thermal load and low wind pass conditions. Open and sparse low-rise buildings constitute the most appropriate urban characteristics for urban built environment in Tainan. By the simple approach of establishing UCmap, the microclimate condition and development intensity of regions can be easily detected and linked, for example the compact high-rise areas should be limited by floor area ratio in order to prevent the formation of hot spots.

Analysis of the results indicates the influence of meteorology on the columnar concentration of these gases.

This paper described the potential for rare places and rare events to exert a disproportionate influence on the movement of elements at the scale of landscapes and ecosystems. Here, we examine how the cleverly named hot spot and hot moment concept (hereafter HSHM) has influenced biogeochemistry and ecosystem science over the last 13 years. We specifically examined the extent to which the HSHM concept has: (1) motivated research aimed at understanding how and why biogeochemical behavior varies across spatiotemporal scales; (2) improved our ability to detect HSHM phenomena; and (3) influenced our approaches to restoration and ecosystem management practices. We found that the HSHM concept has provided a highly fertile framework for a substantial volume of research on the spatial and temporal dynamics of nutrient cycling, and in doing so, has improved our understanding of when and where biogeochemical rates are maximized. Despite the high usage of the term, we found limited examples of rigorous statistical or modeling approaches that would allow ecosystem scientists to not only identify, but scale the aggregate impact of HSHM on ecosystem processes. We propose that the phrase ""hot spots and hot moments"" includes two implicit assumptions that may actually be limiting progress in applying the concept. First, by differentiating ""hot spots"" from ""hot moments,"" the phrase separates the spatial and temporal components of biogeochemical behavior. Instead, we argue that the temporal dynamics of a putative hot spot are a fundamental trait that should be used in their description. Second, the adjective ""hot"" implicitly suggests that a place or a time must be dichotomously classified as ""hot or not."" We suggest instead that each landscape of interest contains a wide range of biogeochemical process rates that respond to critical drivers, and the gradations of this biogeochemical topography are of greater interest than the maximum peaks. For these reasons, we recommend replacing the HSHM terminology with the more nuanced term ecosystem control points. ""Ecosystem control"" suggests that the rate must be of sufficient magnitude or ubiquity to affect dynamics of the ecosystem, while ""points"" allows for descriptions that simultaneously incorporate both spatial and temporal dynamics. We further suggest that there are at least four distinct types of ecosystem control points whose influence arises through distinct hydrologic and biogeochemical mechanisms. Our goal is to provide the tools with which researchers can develop testable hypotheses regarding the spatiotemporal dynamics of biogeochemistry that will stimulate advances in more accurately identifying, modeling and scaling biogeochemical heterogeneity to better understand ecosystem processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON;NEVADA FOREST SOIL;NORTHERN HARDWOOD FOREST;HIGH-FREQUENCY WAVE;NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS;COMMUNITY STRUCTURE;NUTRIENT HOTSPOTS;RIPARIAN ZONES;URBAN IMPACTS;STREAM,,

Rates of urbanization and human population growth are high in tropical countries of the developing world, which also hold most of the world's biodiversity hot-spots, yet few studies have considered biodiversity trends along urban gradients in these regions. Bird communities across a gradient of nine sites in Uganda, from the city centre of Kampala to outlying rural locations, were studied over a six year period. These sites were ordered along an urbanization gradient using Principle Components Analysis based on habitat variables estimated at each site. Bird species richness showed a decrease from rural to urban sites, a trend especially evident in forest birds. There was no clear pattern in total abundance, total biomass or biomass per individual along the gradient. However, this latter result was heavily influenced by a colony of Marabou Storks at one site. When this species was omitted, there was evidence of a positive trend with urbanization, showing that as species richness decreased, the bird community was increasingly dominated by larger species with increasing urbanization, which were mainly scavengers able to exploit human refuse. These results provide further support for the negative impacts of urbanization on species richness, but also demonstrate trends in abundance and biomass are variable across different regions. In particular, the increasing dominance of larger species in urban areas may be relevant to certain geographic and/or socioeconomic contexts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,URBAN;BIODIVERSITY;ASSEMBLAGES;DIVERSITY;AVIFAUNA;ECOLOGY;CONSERVATION;COMMUNITIES;HABITATS;PATTERN,,

In our study strains of Aeromonas spp. (n = 104) not susceptible to ampicillin were isolated from municipal sewage of different levels of purification - raw sewage, activated sludge and treated wastewater. The crucial step of the study was the identification of beta-lactamase resistance genes. The identified genes encode beta-lactamases from 14 families - bla(TEM), bla(OXA), bla(SHV), bla(CTX-M), bla(MOX), bla(ACC), bla(FOX), bla(GES), bla(PER), bla(VEB), bla(KPC), cphA, imiH, and cepH. There were no significant differences in number of identified ARGs between isolation points. Bla(OXA), bla(FOX) variants and, characteristic for Aeromonas genus, metallo-beta-lactamase cphA-related genes were the most commonly identified types of beta-lactam resistance determinants. Moreover, we found four extended-spectrum b-lactamases (bla(SHV-11), bla(CTX-M-27), bla(CTX-M-98), and bla(PER-4)) - and seven AmpC (bla(ACC), bla(FOX-2-like), bla(FOX-3), bla(FOX-4-like), bla(FOX-9), bla(FOX-10-like), and bla(FOX-13-like)) types and variants of genes that had never been found among Aeromonas spp. before. Five of the b-lactamases families (bla(TEM), bla(OXA), bla(FOX), bla(VEB), and cphA) were identified in all three isolation sites, which supports the hypothesis that wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) are hot spots of ARGs dissemination. The obtained ARGs sequences share high identity with previously described beta-lactamases, but new variants of those genes have to be considered as well. Characterization of antibiotic susceptibility was performed using disk the diffusion method with 12 different antibiotics according to CLSI guidelines. Over 60% of the strains are unsusceptible to cefepime and chloramphenicol and the majority of the strains have a multidrug resistance phenotype (68%). Finally, analysis of plasmid profiles among the resistant strains showed that 62% of the isolates from all three points of the WWTP carry plasmids of different sizes. Among some of the isolated plasmids bla(FOX-4-like) and blaGES genes have been found. To sum up, the results strongly suggest that Aeromonas spp. can be considered as agents of antibiotic resistance dissemination from wastewater to the natural environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE GENES;KLEBSIELLA-PNEUMONIAE;ANTIMICROBIAL        RESISTANCE;SPECTRUM;BACTERIA;PREVALENCE;DIVERSITY;INTEGRONS;ENVIRONMENT;SEQUENCE,,

This paper describes the design of an integrated transportation and air quality modelling framework capable of simulating traffic emissions and air pollution at a refined spatio-temporal scale. For this purpose, emissions of Nitrogen Oxides (NOx) were estimated in the Greater Montreal Region at the level of individual trips and vehicles. In turn, hourly Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2) concentrations were simulated across different seasons and validated against observations. Our validation results reveal a reasonable performance of the modelling chain. The modelling system was used to evaluate the impact of an extensive regional transit improvement strategy revealing reductions in NO2 concentrations across the territory by about 3.6% compared to the base case in addition to a decrease in the frequency and severity of NO2 hot spots. This is associated with a reduction in total NOx emissions of 1.9% compared'to the base case; some roads experienced reductions by more than half. Finally, a methodology for assessing individuals' daily exposure is developed (by tracking activity locations and trajectories) and we observed a reduction of 20.8% in daily exposures compared to the base case. The large difference between reductions in the mean NO2 concentration across the study domain and the mean NO2 exposure across the sample population results from the fact that NO2 concentrations dropped largely in the areas which attract the most individuals. This exercise illustrates that evaluating the air quality impacts of transportation scenarios by solely quantifying reductions in air pollution concentrations across the study domain would lead to an underestimation of the potential health gains.

Although conversion of existing agriculturally intensive lands (e.g., maize and soy) to perennial bioenergy cropping systems has been shown to reduce near-surface temperatures, unintended consequences on natural water resources via depletion of soil moisture may offset these benefits. The hydroclimatic impacts associated with perennial bioenergy crop expansion over the contiguous United States are quantified using the Weather Research and Forecasting Model dynamically coupled to a land surface model (LSM). A suite of continuous (2000-09) medium-range resolution (20-km grid spacing) ensemble-based simulations is conducted using seasonally evolving biophysical representation of perennial bioenergy cropping systems within the LSM based on observational data. Deployment is carried out only over suitable abandoned and degraded farmlands to avoid competition with existing food cropping systems. Results show that near-surface cooling (locally, up to 5 degrees C) is greatest during the growing season over portions of the central United States. For some regions, principal impacts are restricted to a reduction in near-surface temperature (e.g., eastern portions of the United States), whereas for other regions deployment leads to soil moisture reduction in excess of 0.15-0.2 m(3) m(-3) during the simulated 10-yr period (e.g., western Great Plains). This reduction (similar to 25%-30% of available soil moisture) manifests as a progressively decreasing trend over time. The large-scale focus of this research demonstrates the long-term hydroclimatic sustainability of large-scale deployment of perennial bioenergy crops across the continental United States, revealing potential hot spots of suitable deployment and regions to avoid.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CLIMATE IMPACTS;BIOFUEL CROPS;COVER CHANGE;MODEL;WATER;SWITCHGRASS;AGRICULTURE;MISCANTHUS;BIOMASS;EVAPOTRANSPIRATION;United States,,

The numbers of death of hypertension disease (HD), ischemic heart disease (IHD), and cerebrovascular disease (CVD) are investigated, and 14 representative socioeconomic and environmental factors are collected. Stepwise regression model (SRM) and geographically weighted regression model (GWRM) are applied to determine the spatial correlation between the number of death of those diseases and selected factors. The results are the following: (1) diseases exhibit a pattern of zonal distribution. Higher HD is mostly distributed in south district, whereas higher IHD and CVD are observed in the north area. (2) SO2 emission amount (SO2 EA) is significantly positively related with HD, while coal consumption (CC) and PM2.5 are notably positively correlated with IHD and CVD. (3) A 10,000 tons increase in SO2 EA results in three increases in the numbers of death of HD. For every 100 ten thousand tons (TTTs) increase in CC, the death of IHD and CVD increases by 11.1 and 15.7, while for every 1 mu g/m(3) increase in ambient PM2.5 concentration, the numbers of death of IHD and CVD increase by 34.773 and 43.222, respectively.

We quantified the medication possession ratio (MPR) and characterized the distribution of medication nonpossession in a network of clinics in Zambia to identify 'hotspots' and predictors of poorer adherence.        Methods: We analyzed a population of adults on ART for more than 3 months who made at least one clinic visit between 1 January 2013 and 28 February 2015. Pharmacy refill and clinical information were obtained through the electronic medical record system used in routine care. We constructed a Lorenz curve to visualize the distribution of poor adherence and used a multilevel logistic regression model to examine factors associated with MPR.        Results: Among 131 767 patients in 56 clinics [64% women, median age 34 years (interquartile range (IQR) 29-41), median CD4(+) cell count at ART initiation 351 cells/mu l (IQR 220-517)], the median MPR was 85.8% ( IQR 70.8-96.8). During months 7-12 on ART, 45.6% of patients had 100% MPR and 10.5% accounted for 50% of medication nonpossession. Across clinics, median MPR ranged from 49.1 to 98.5, and clinic accounted for 12% of the variability in adherence after adjusting for individual and clinic-level characteristics.        Conclusion: A small fraction of patients account for the majority of days of medication nonpossession. Further characterization of these subpopulations is needed to target interventions. Clinic also accounted for much variability in MPR. Health systems interventions targeting clinic 'hot spots' may represent an efficient use of resources to improve ART adherence.

Suppression of Ae. albopictus is difficult because of the abundance and prevalence of larval habitats within peridomestic environments, particularly cryptic habitats such as corrugated extension spouts, fence post openings, discarded food containers, etc. Because of the challenges of eliminating or treating larval habitats of this species, we tested an autodissemination concept to contaminate these habitats with the insect growth regulator pyriproxyfen.        Methods: Our study was conducted in the City of Trenton (Mercer County), New Jersey, USA (40 degrees 12'N, 74 degrees 44'W). We selected six hot spots, where five or more Ae. albopictus males or females were collected based on weekly trap surveillance. A trapping unit was a city block, approximately 0.8 ha (hot spot), where we deployed 26 to 28 autodissemination stations per treatment plot. To gauge efficacy, we deployed BGS traps, oviposition cups, and sentinel cups in treatment and control locations.        Results: We found a significant reduction in eggs (P < 0.0001) and larval populations (P < 0.0001) as a result of treatment. Pupal mortality, as determined through bioassays, was also significantly higher in the treatment sites (P < 0.0001).        Conclusion: Our results clearly show the potential and unique use of the autodissemination stations to control immature Ae. albopictus in urban areas. Penetration of larvicides with existing methods are difficult to reach cryptic habitats, but the autodissemination approach, which exploits the oviposition behavior of the target pest, can be integrated into intervention programs. New tools are urgently needed to curb the expansion and public health implications of Ae. albopictus and other container-inhabiting species.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,INSECT GROWTH-REGULATOR;SOURCE REDUCTION;SUBURBAN NEIGHBORHOODS;OVIPOSITION RESPONSES;PIEDMONT COMMUNITY;AEGYPTI L.;DIPTERA;CULICIDAE;MOSQUITO;VECTOR;Aedes,,

However, due to the lack of geospatial fertilizer input data, current Earth system and land surface modeling studies have to ignore or use oversimplified data (e. g., static, spatially uniform fertilizer use) to characterize agricultural N and P input over decadal or century-long periods. In this study, we therefore develop global time series gridded data of annual synthetic N and P fertilizer use rate in agricultural lands, matched with HYDE 3.2 historical land use maps, at a resolution of 0.5 degrees x 0.5 degrees latitude-longitude during 1961-2013. Our data indicate N and P fertilizer use rates on per unit cropland area increased by approximately 8 times and 3 times, respectively, since the year 1961 when IFA (International Fertilizer Industry Association) and FAO (Food and Agricultural Organization) surveys of country-level fertilizer input became available. Considering cropland expansion, the increase in total fertilizer consumption is even larger. Hotspots of agricultural N fertilizer application shifted from the US and western Europe in the 1960s to eastern Asia in the early 21st century. P fertilizer input shows a similar pattern with an additional current hotspot in Brazil. We found a global increase in fertilizer N / P ratio by 0.8 gNg(-1) P per decade (p < 0.05) during 1961-2013, which may have an important global implication for human impacts on agroecosystem functions in the long run.

The sources of groundwater contamination can be classified into two different categories: 1) point sources (PS), which are identified areas releasing plumes of high/very high concentrations (i.e. hot-spots) and 2) multiple-point sources (MPS) constituted by a series of unidentifiable small sources clustered in a large area, generating a diffuse contamination. The latter category predominates in European Functional Urban Areas and cannot be managed with the usual remediation techniques such as those conceived for large/medium contaminated sites, mainly because of the difficulty to identify the many different source areas releasing small contaminant mass. Consequently, the usual remediation procedures are not economically sustainable and often fail to provide results in an acceptable time frame. A powerful tool in this context is transport modeling, as it can be used in combination with statistical methods to assess MPS groundwater contamination even in a highly undetermined setting. Due to the uncertainty related to the exact position and intensity of MPS, a numerical model (MODFLOW/MT3DMS) was implemented in a pilot area in the North-Eastern sector of the Milano FUA. Using the inverse calibration code PEST, a model was calibrated representing the diffuse PCE source field (Italian Law limit is within 1.1 mu g/l). This was then used as input to a statistical process based on the Null-Space Monte Carlo (NSMC) method, which allows to generate unlimited sets of sources, all respecting the measured concentrations. 99 different realisations were thus obtained, each attributing a contaminant inflow (with varying concentrations) to every cell of the model top layer. The model minimizing the objective function (composed by the diffuse concentration targets in monitoring wells), gives useful information to assess the overall contaminant sources distribution and to identify the probability of each domain sector to contribute to the contaminant mass inflow.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,MODEL;Monte Carlo Method,,

However, little is known about CO2 emissions from urban river networks suffering anthropogenic disturbance in the context of global urbanization. We surveyed the partial pressure of carbon dioxide (pCO(2)) and CO2 flux from 84 locations in the Chongqing metropolitan river network, with an area of 5494 km(2). The overall mean pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes were 2152 mu atm and 163.0 mol Cm-2 yr(-1), respectively, with 318.9 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) from rivers in the completely urban area and 49.6 mol Cm-2 yr(-1) from the least urbanized area. The riverine pCO(2) level increased with the proportion of urban land, with 2-4 times higher CO2 flux in the urban areas than the remote rural ones. Sites with low flow velocity, narrow channel, and factitious bottom sediment appeared to be local hot spots of CO2 emission. The pCO(2) and CO2 degassing was positively correlated with the nutrients content of surface water (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus). Carbon was released to the atmosphere as CO2 from Chongqing metropolitan river network at a rate of 12.3 x 10(9) mol C yr(-1). pCO(2) exhibited a clear seasonality with lower values in March 2015 and June 2015 but a higher value in September 2014, which was coregulated by temperature, flood dilution, and in situ photosynthesis. The results highlight that rapid urbanization, with increasing nutrients loading and anthropogenic activities, will alter the carbon biogeochemical cycle in the terrestrial-aqueous-atmospheric ecosystem and then impact global CO2 budgets.        Plain Language Summary Urbanization and greenhouse gases emission are of great global concern, especially in developing countries like China. However, we know little about the relationship between these two issues. We surveyed the pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes from the Chongqing metropolitan river network with high spatial resolution samplings. We found that riverine pCO(2) and CO2 fluxes increased with the degree of urbanization or the proportion of urban land use, with 2-4 times higher CO2 flux in the urban than remote and rural areas. Regression analysis indicated that nutrient content (i.e., nitrogen and phosphorus), bottom sediment, and dissolved oxygen of surface water were closely related to pCO(2). The rapid urbanization process with increasing nutrients loading and riverbed artificialization will alter the carbon biogeochemical cycle in the terrestrial-aqueous-atmospheric ecosystem and then impacted global CO2 budgets.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,GAS TRANSFER VELOCITY;UPPER YANGTZE-RIVER;CARBON-DIOXIDE;LAND-USE;PARTIAL-PRESSURE;SURFACE-WATER;TEMPORAL VARIABILITY;METHANE        EMISSIONS;AMAZONIAN RIVERS;ORGANIC-CARBON;China,,

Although strong evidence exists that hot spots policing will reduce crime at hot spots without immediate spatial displacement, we know little about its possible jurisdictional or large-area impacts. We cannot isolate such effects in previous experiments because they (appropriately) compare treatment and control hot spots within large urban communities, thus, confounding estimates of area-wide impacts. An agent-based model is used to estimate area-wide impacts of hot spots policing on street robbery. We test two implementations of hot spots policing (representing different levels of resource allocation) in a simulated borough of a city, and we compare them with two control conditions, one model with constant random patrol and another with no police officers. Our models estimate the short-and long-term impacts on large-area robbery levels of these different schemes of policing resources. These experiments reveal statistically significant effects for hot spots policing beyond both a random patrol model and a landscape without police. These simulations suggest that wider application of hot spots policing can have significant impacts on overall levels of crime in urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,ROUTINE ACTIVITIES;MICRO PLACES;PATROL TIME;CRIMINOLOGY;STABILITY;DIFFUSION;PATTERNS;DISORDER;EXAMPLE;TRENDS;Crime,,

The current study assessed the geographical variation of lung cancer among ever and never smokers in Crete during the last 20 years.        Method: Lung cancer patient records (1992-2013) including information on medical history and smoking habits were obtained from the Cancer Registry of Crete. Age-Adjusted Incidence Rates (AAIR), prevalence of smoking among lung cancer patients and the Population-Attributable Fraction (PAF%) of tobacco smoking were estimated. Kaplan-Meier curves, grouped per smoking status were constructed, and spatio-temporal analyses were carried out to assess the geographical variations of lung cancer and smoking (a = 0.05).

AAIRs ranged from 25 to 50/100,000/ year, while significant geographical differences were observed among the municipalities of Crete (p = 0.02). Smokers living in the south-east urban regions presented higher risk of dying from lung cancer (RR = 2.2; 95% CI = 1.3-3.5).        Conclusions: The constant increase of lung cancer rates among both genders, especially in females, outlines the need for targeted, geographically-oriented, life-style preventive measures. Design of population-based screening programs, tobacco awareness campaigns and smoking cessation programs in lung cancer hot spots could be guide by these findings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,BRITISH DOCTORS;RISK-FACTORS;FOLLOW-UP;MORTALITY;SURVIVAL;PREVALENCE;PATTERNS;Registries;Lung Neoplasms;Lung;Smoke;Smoking;Greece,,

Design Hierarchical Bayesian Poisson space-time analysis to relate annual discharges fromcommunity hospitals to postal code characteristics over 10 years. Setting California, USA. Participants Residents of 18 517 postal codes in California, 2001-11. Measurements Annual postal code-level counts of hospital discharges due to PO poisoning were related to postal code pharmacy density, measures ofmedical need for POs (i.e. rates of cancer and arthritis-related hospital discharges), economic stressors (i.e. median household income, percentage of families in poverty and the unemployment rate) and concentration of manual labor industries. Findings PO-related hospital discharges spread from rural and suburban/exurban 'hot-spots' to urban areas. They increased more in postal codes with greater pharmacy density [rate ratio (RR) = 1.03; 95% credible interval (CI) = 1.01, 1.05], more arthritis-related hospital discharges (RR = 1.08; 95% CI = 1.06, 1.11), lower income (RR = 0.85; 95% CI = 0.83, 0.87) andmoremanual labor industries (RR = 1.15; 95% CI = 1.10, 1.19 for construction; RR = 1.12; 95% CI = 1.04, 1.20 for manufacturing industries).

The Selenga River is the largest tributary (more than 50% of the inflow) to the Lake Baikal. Due to ongoing hydroclimatic change and human pressures under conditions of economic growth, the rivers of the area experience significant change in water quality.

Our research aims to evaluate the pathways and mass flows of heavy metals and metalloids both in dissolved and suspended forms, taking a basin- scale perspective that previously has not been fully pursued in the Lake Baikal region. Results showed quality deterioration over short distances due to strong impact of hot spots from urban and industrial activities, including mining.

In reality, the passenger seeking strategies are mostly empirical and substantially vary among taxi drivers. From the history taxi data, the top performing taxi drivers can earn 25% more than the ones with mediocre seeking strategy in the same period of time. A better strategy not only helps taxi drivers earn more with less effort, but also reduce fuel consumption and carbon emissions. It is interesting to examine the influential factors in passenger seeking strategies and find algorithms to guide taxi drivers to passenger hotspots with the right timing. With the abundant availability of history taxicab traces, the existing methods of doing taxi business have been radically changed. This paper focuses on the problem of mining efficient operation strategies from a large-scale history taxi traces collected over one year. Our approach presents generic insights into the dynamics of taxicab services with the objective of maximizing the profit margins for the concerned parties. We propose important metrics, such as trip frequency, hot spots, and taxi mileage, and provide valuable insights toward more efficient operation strategies. We analyze these metrics using techniques, such as Newton's polynomial interpolation and Gamma distribution, to understand their dynamics. Our strategies use the real taxicab traces from the city of Changsha (P.R.China), may predict the taxi rides at different times by 90.68% per day, and increase the taxi drivers income levels up to 19.38% by controlling appropriate mileage per trip and following the route across more urban hot spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

The theory explains why, over time, officers involved in hot spots policing interventions would leave the hot spots they are assigned to police and begin working within other locations. We test what factors influence the amounts of activity that officers undertake outside of their assigned hot spots and at nearby streets using data gathered as part of the Philadelphia Foot Patrol Experiment. Officers performed more activity outside of their beats as the experiment progressed. Several theoretically relevant variables predict the level of activity that officers perform outside their beats, including the size of the target area and the amounts of crime occurring within and outside of the target area. ""Dosage diffusion"" might be one reason why hot spot interventions have diminishing effects over time. From an optimal foraging theory perspective, hot spots requiring police officers to constrain their actions to pre-defined areas can be perceived as counter-intuitive by the officers, especially over extended periods of time. The results of this study support the suggestion that hot spots patrols should be short-term and randomly rotated across hot spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,FOOT PATROL;CRIME,,

More than half of the Swedish population have access to second homes. Previous studies have revealed that there is great variation between different second homes. Examples range from rustic Australian shacks, lonely cabins in the Norwegian mountains, spacious Swedish archipelago villas and palatial Russian dachas. Still, second homes are often seen and analysed as a unitary category - a perspective that obscures the considerable heterogeneity within the category as well as spatial differences in the impact of second-home tourism. Using a second-home typology from previous research and data on about 660,000 second homes, we analyse the heterogeneity of second homes by mapping the composition of the Swedish second-home stock. Results show the uneven geography of second-home tourism, revealing significant and sometimes steep differences between peripheral areas and urban hinterlands, tourism hot-spots, and areas in decline. Based on these results, we assert that there is good cause to move away from using second homes as a unitary category. Instead, we argue for viewing second homes as an umbrella concept with dwelling use in focus. This enables a greater sensibility to place and more accurate analyses of the uneven impacts of second-home tourism.

The U.S. Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) 100-year flood maps, land cover data, and census data were used to extract the proportion of developed (urban) land in flood zones by county at the two time points, and indexes of difference were calculated. Local Moran's I statistic was applied to identify hot spots of increase in urban area in flood zones, and geographically weighted regression was used to estimate the population in flood zones from the land cover data. Results show that in 2011, an estimate of about 25.3million people (8.3 percent of the total population) lived in high-risk flood zones. Nationally, the ratio of urban development in flood zones is less than the ratio of land in flood zones, implying that Americans were responsive to flood hazards by avoiding development in flood zones. This trend varied from place to place, however, with coastal counties having less urban development in flood zones than the inland counties. Furthermore, the contrast between coastal and inland counties increased between 2001 and 2011. Finally, several exceptions from the trend (hot spots) were detected, most notably in New York City and Miami, where significant increases in urban development in flood zones were found. This assessment provides important baseline information on the spatial patterns of flood exposure and their changes from 2001 to 2011.

Clustering for the entire population of hotels in Madrid was explored visualizing LISA statistics. Then, a system generalized method of moments regression was applied to test a set of hypotheses about the performance effects of LISA statistics for a sample of upscale urban hotels.        Findings - Two significantly distinct types of clusters are identified: dense ""cold spots"" or clusters containing many low-priced hotels and quiet ""hot spots"" or clusters only containing a few high-priced hotels.

Geographic information systems (GIS) were used to visualise the spatial distribution of malaria infection rates. Spatial scan statistics was deployed to detect spatial clustering of high infection rates. Among 2407 patients tested for malaria, 46.6% (1121) could be traced to their 411 different residential housing clusters. One small spatially aggregated cluster of neighbourhoods with high prevalence was identified. While the home residence housing cluster leader was unambiguously identified for 73.8% (240/325) of malaria-positive patients, only 42.3% (881/2082) of those with negative test results were successfully traced. It was concluded that recording simple points of reference during routine health facility visits can be used for mapping malaria infection burden on very fine geographic scales, potentially offering a feasible approach to rational geographic targeting of malaria control interventions.

This paper argues that the specific conditions in shrinking middle-size cities create an especially difficult environment for energy renovations. Using empirical data from the shrinking City of Delitzsch, Germany, it is hypothesized that buildings with poor energy efficiency are often inhabited by tenants or owners who impede retrofit activities due to their socio-economic conditions. The research analyzes the relation between buildings with a high potential for final energy reduction and a concentration of low-income, older or empty-nest households. The analysis examines this relation not only on an aggregated city level but also on the level of the city's districts to identify renovation hot spots' in the city. Specific challenges are identified for building renovations in shrinking cities due to a high concentration of possible barriers in the relevant housing stock. As a further consequence, those households with a low net-equivalent income are also at risk of energy poverty. In order to achieve a low-carbon and just society, possible actions are suggested for buildings with elevated barriers to energy renovation in shrinking cities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS;ENERGY-CONSUMPTION;PERSPECTIVE;PERFORMANCE,,

Bayesian in-ference techniques were used to account for the uncertainty associated with the existing knowledge from the system as well as the sampling/analytical error of the calibration data. Our analysis suggests that urban areas are characterized by a fairly high areal phosphorus export with an approximate mean estimate of 120 kg of TP per km(2) on an annual basis. The contribution of phosphorus from agricultural land can vary considerably among the various crop types (30-127 TP kg per 1km(2)), but is generally lower than the impact of urban areas. Crop-specific (oat, wheat corn, alfalfa, and fallow) export coefficient values were generally on par with those typically reported in the literature. Our analysis also suggests that the attenuation rate in low flow streams (3.7% of TP per kilometer) is distinctly greater than in those with high flow (1.1% of TP per kilometer). Using posterior simulations, we obtained TP loading estimates from ungauged subwatersheds in the area that were twice as high relative to values historically used. The predictive uncertainty of phosphorus export from different sub-basins was also used to delineate ""hot-spots"" in the Bay of Quinte watershed that may be responsible for significant nutrient fluxes, due to their landscape attributes and soil characteristics. Our predictions can be used as pointers for maximizing the value of information of additional monitoring by determining locations where data collection efforts should focus on. The key findings of the present modelling study will be ultimately linked with process based models developed for the receiving waterbody to shed light on the causal connections among phosphorus loading, sediment-water column interactions, and plankton community response.

To minimize these effects emissions must be monitored. This study proposed application of portable gas detector (PGD) in point and scanning measurements to estimate spatial distribution of methane emissions in landfills. The aims of this study were to discover the advantages and disadvantages of point and scanning methods in measuring methane concentrations, discover spatial distribution of methane emissions, cognize the correlation between ambient methane concentration and methane flux, and estimate methane flux and emissions in landfills. This study was carried out in Tamangapa landfill, Makassar city Indonesia. Measurement areas were divided into basic and expanded area. In the point method, PGD was held one meter above the landfill surface, whereas scanning method used a PGD with a data logger mounted on a wire drawn between two poles. Point method was efficient in time, only needed one person and eight minutes in measuring 400 m(2) areas, whereas scanning method could capture a lot of hot spots location and needed 20 min. The results from basic area showed that ambient methane concentration and flux had a significant (p < 0.01) positive correlation with R-2 = 0.7109 and y = 0.1544 x. This correlation equation was used to describe spatial distribution of methane emissions in the expanded area by using Kriging method. The average of estimated flux from scanning method was 71.2 g m(-2) d(-1) higher than 38.3 g m(-2) d(-1) from point method. Further, scanning method could capture the lower and higher value, which could be useful to evaluate and estimate the possible effects of the uncontrolled emissions in landfill.

Since 1990, the University of Padova has been carrying on an interdisciplinary research project of excavation, architectural analysis, historical reconstruction and cultural promotion of tourism in this site. The excavations allow us to increase our knowledge of Middle Imperial Roman urban planning and to get a better understanding of the whole city and its history; the restoration of excavated monuments using gravels with different colours helps more than 60,000 tourists every year to recognize the function of different areas. In spite of this, visitors experience difficulty in understanding a landscape of ruins with barely visible evidence. Thus, a complete virtual reconstruction of the ancient city has become essential. 3D models of the Phoenician and Roman settlement have been developed, reshaping archaeological plans produced in 25 years by Universities that work in the site. The main monuments of the Roman city and the major crossroads have been rendered in greater detail, using sample-based textures that give a photorealistic effect and implementing the models with furniture and decorations selected through reliable sources of information. 3D reconstructions are now available for tourist groups led by a guide in the Nora Virtual Tour: stereoscopic images have been rendered and uploaded in an app for mobile headsets that provides immersive virtual reality for the users. The guide controls the devices with a tablet using a Bluetooth connection: at the beginning of the visit, the tourists can view equirectangular panoramas of the ruins taken from a helicopter, then they are accompanied to hot-spots where the ancient monuments are shown in an evocative Roman reconstruction.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,Immersion,,

A point pattern analysis methodology of 1,437 bicycle accidents that resulted in injury or death in the city center of Vienna, Austria, between 2012 and 2014 is described. Network-based kernel density estimation was used to examine the hot spots of bicycle accidents, and the network-based nearest-neighbor distance was taken into account to check the significance of the hot spots. Moreover, the global cross nearest-neighbor distance was used to test the effect of urban components on the distribution of bicycle accidents. An understanding of the temporal and conditional differences was obtained by analyzing the accident data in terms of four classifications: all accident data and then the accident data classified according to season, light conditions. and precipitation conditions. It was concluded that the bicycle accident hot spots varied in space according to season, light, and precipitation conditions. Also, these detected hot spots were significant for the pattern of accidents, no matter what classification was used. Besides these points, at the .95 confidence level, bicycle accidents tended to cluster by signalized intersections, bus and tram stations, subway stations, and city bike stations. As a result, a systematic framework was proposed for spatiotemporal analysis of bicycle accidents for the built environment. The framework can serve as a guide to determine effective strategies for cyclist safety in urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicatas",,Austria,,

We utilized an opportunity to assess the outcome of a test and cull programme aimed at limiting the spread of Mycobacterium bovis in African buffalo. Buffalo act as reservoirs of M. bovis, the causative agent of bovine tuberculosis (BTB), which can have major economic, ecological and public health impacts through the risk of infection to other wildlife species, livestock and surrounding communities. BTB prevalence data were collected in conjunction with disease control operations in Hluhluwe-iMfolozi Park, South Africa, from 1999 to 2006. A total of 4733 buffalo (250-950 per year) were tested for BTB using the single comparative intradermal tuberculin (SCIT) test, with BTB-positive animals culled, and negative animals released. BTB prevalence was spatially and temporally variable, ranging from 2.3% to 54.7%. Geographic area was a strong predictor of BTB transmission in HiP, owing to relatively stable herds and home ranges. Herds experiencing more intensive and frequent captures showed reduced per capita disease transmission risk and less increase in herd prevalence over time. Disease hot spots did not expand spatially over time, and BTB prevalence in all but the hot spot areas was maintained between 10% and 15% throughout the study period. Our data suggest that HiP's test and cull programme was effective at reducing BTB transmission in buffalo, with capture effort and interval found to be the crucial components of the programme. The programme was thus successful with respect to the original goals; however, there are additional factors that should be considered in future cost/benefit analyses and decision-making. These findings may be utilized and expanded in future collaborative work between wildlife managers, veterinarians and scientists, to optimize wildlife disease control programmes and mitigate conflict at the interface of conservation, agricultural and urban areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,MYCOBACTERIUM-BOVIS;SYNCERUS-CAFFER;CATTLE;INTERFACE;IMPACTS;PARK;Tuberculosis,,

However, researches related to spatial-temporal data mining and forecasting on property crime driven by traffic factors are rare. The BP neural network model improved by genetic algorithm (GA-BP neural network), which utilize Machine Learning to mine the factor weights of the property crime, can describe these complicated relationships to forecast more effectively. This study collected spatialtemporal data of property crime that occurred at city A located in South China in the period from 2008 to 2012, filtered the factors of property crime by correlation analysis, and selected the neighbors by spatial autocorrelation. This study also standardized the data, with one year as the time window and 100mx100m as the spatial dimension. Property crime is forecasted based on the GA-BP neural network, and the root mean square error is 0.019. Current researches demonstrate that the correlation between property crime and factors, like urban transport, network density, floating population and economic indicator, is significant. This study confirms that the GA-BP neural network model based on GIS is a reasonable forecast model in the field of property crime forecast research. Given its features, the GA-BP neural network model can forecast other types of rational crime and can set the time window and spatial dimension to obtain the corresponding forecast result based on the accuracy of input data.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,GENETIC ALGORITHM;HOT-SPOTS;MODEL;EDUCATION;Crime,,

This study aimed to investigate the UHI phenomenon and outdoor thermal comfort on a micro-scale of the different areas in a planned city. A mobile survey and fixed station measurements were performed to investigate the intra-urban air temperature within the city. The thermal comfort condition of the different hot spots of the urban area in the city was investigated by using Envi-met V4 Beta software. The results indicate that the maximum UHI occurred during the afternoon and reached 3 degrees C in low-rise residential buildings. The high-rise residential buildings and the Boulevard street are 4 degrees C lower than low-rise buildings and 1 degrees C lower than nearby suburban areas. The city's human thermal comfort exceeds the natural range of 30 degrees C. However, the high-rise residential buildings and the Boulevard street are thermally comfortable most of the daytime hours, while low-rise buildings suffer from a long period of heat stress. The diffuse, reflected solar radiation and the surface temperature have an influence on increasing the Physiologically Equivalent Temperature (PET) thermal index within the city, while the wind velocity and building height are the essential variables reducing the PET thermal index.

Now more than ever it is essential to understand and map at the appropriate scale the processes happening along the verticality and horizontality of cities, to gather robust evidence underpinning strategies for sustainable management of the built environment. This paper explores how established techniques of Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI) can be shaped into a novel dedicated procedure to detect vertical and horizontal urban dynamics including: use and re-use of urban space (new building construction, intentional demolition, renovation projects); exploitation of groundwater resources (induced land subsidence); interactions between new foundations, superficial deposits and bedrock geology (settlement of recent buildings); ground and slope instability affecting settled buildings; susceptibility of heritage assets to structural damages; baseline characterisation prior to planned major infrastructure construction (tunnelling and transportation networks). Florence, central Italy, is used as a demonstration site. This city includes UNESCO World Heritage List historic centre, 20th-century residential, industrial and peri-urban quarters, and is currently in transition to metropolitan area of over 1 million of inhabitants. Velocity decomposition maps were generated based on millimetre-precise estimates of surface displacements retrieved from PSI processing of the full archives of satellite C-band radar images, including 79 ERS-1/2 descending (1992-2000), 70 ENVISAT ASAR ascending and descending (2003-2010) and 101 RADARSAT-1 ascending and descending (2003-2007). 12 macropatterns and 84 micropatterns in the final map of alert areas highlight a dualism which reflects the physical and urban geography of Florence. North-western and south-western quarters show hot spots of new building construction and regeneration projects for residential, business and tertiary service purposes, alongside issues due to groundwater exploitation and induced land subsidence up to 30-40 mm/yr. Local interactions with underlying geology and natural slope instability processes predominate in the southern and north-eastern sectors. At local scale, stable condition was found for the heritage assets and buildings located along the tracks of the planned subway railway and tramway, with motion rates averagely within 1.5 mm/yr and localised deformation only up to -3.5 mm/yr. Structural assessment based on future PSI monitoring campaign will benefit of this baseline characterisation. (C) 2016 The Authors.

These hot-spots, labeled Impact Zones, are sites of mobility constrained and structured by biometric and spatial technologies borrowed from the military. This article analyzes the city's advanced police profiling technologies as they play out within Impact Zones. The profiling is racial, social, biometric, bio-political, and spatial, and works to demarcate dangerous people and places. Because this profiling technology is enacted spatially and governs residents' mobility, I argue for a new conceptual apparatus, which I call bio-spatial profiling. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork in police hot-spots, policy analysis, and textual analysis of media articles, I argue that the lived experience of biospatial profiling is one of pervasive fear which governs mobilities in Impact Zones. Next, I trace the experiences of Northeast Brooklyn residents back to their sources, and find three bio-spatial practices: both biometric and spatial data collection, and police street-stops. These symbiotic practices inform and strengthen each other, congealing to produce fear and immobility for those they target. The article concludes with a discussion of the conflicting understandings of (in)security in Impact Zones that connects the practices with the experiences of bio-spatial profiling, to illuminate the human costs of militarized securitization of domestic urban life.

To obtain a better understanding of the spatial pattern of urban crime, the city of Beijing is chosen as a study area and GIS software is employed to collect spatial data. The authors try to establish the quantitative representation of geographical characteristics of crime associated with urban space in order to create a geographical model of urban crime and space. The authors find that the overall spatial distribution of urban crime in Beijing displays a picture of polycentric structure and distance decay, and that the spatial distribution of urban crime has a reference to traffic centres, concentration of urban commerce and population migration. The numbers of suspects and locations where different types of crime happen have inter-annual variation, while both the total number of crime sites and their criminal density within each district are relatively stable. The authors point out that the spatio-temporal characteristics of sites act on both the participants in property crimes and the criminal factors, which will decide whether or not an offender can commit a crime successfully. The hot spots and periods of time of urban crime in Beijing have a close relation to the fact that success in committing a property crime is based on certain conditions of sites and times which appear in Beijing's environment. In this sense, socio-spatial dialectic provides a better understanding of the dynamics of China's crime space.

Methods: Birth certificate data from the Kentucky Department of Health for 2004-2010 were combined with county-level geographic base files, Census 2010 demographic and socioeconomic data, and Rural-Urban Continuum Codes to conduct a spatial statistical analysis of community rates of breastfeeding initiation.        Results: Between 2004 and 2010, the average rate of breastfeeding initiation for Kentucky increased from 43.84% to 49.22%. Simultaneously, the number of counties identified as breastfeeding initiation hot spots also increased, displaying a systematic geographic pattern in doing so. Cool spots of breastfeeding initiation persisted in rural, Appalachian Kentucky. Spatial regression results suggested that unemployment, income, race, education, location, and the availability of International Board Certified Lactation Consultants are connected to breastfeeding initiation.

Rotterdam's sustainability office initiated a knowledge co-production process in which visions and transition pathways for the sustainable and resilient future of Rotterdam, considering existing challenges and opportunities, were co-created. These scenarios were analyzed using a straightforward scenario approach to spatially identify, map and analyze change. By mapping change, trade-offs and synergies between different land-use options among the scenarios, this study disentangles the complexity of a stakeholder co-production process and is able to discover crucial transition areas. Furthermore, multiple urban ecosystem services were valued for each scenario, and environmental impacts could be detected for all of the different visions. The mapping approach applied is a good method to communicate the consequences of induced land-use change back to stakeholders and decision-makers and thus contributes to the visual loop of real co-design. Identifying the hot-spots of change enables attention to be drawn to the most rewarding areas for transition, and moreover, it shows areas in which different visions are not conflicting but rather cross-benefiting each other. Additionally, hard-spots or areas in which existing visions contradict each other show that careful mediation and the revision of change options might be the way to go. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Smoothed maps of presence and cover percent showed a strong clustering pattern for all three invasive shrubs despite their different ranges. The species are clustered around major cities or urban areas (e.g., Chicago, Illinois, and Des Moines, Iowa), indicating the potential role humans played in their invasion and spread on the landscape and throughout the Midwest. Conditional inference tree (ctree) models further quantified the significant factors contributing to the observed regional patterns: for distribution of multiflora rose, percentage of forest cover in the county (measuring human disturbance intensity) and stand density index; for distribution of common buckthorn, distance to major highways. Non-native bush honeysuckles were not associated with any disturbance and site/stand variables except for latitude and longitude. The infested FIA plots by cover class were positively associated in space, signifying a concentric-like spread trend from previously infested sites (hot spots) to surrounding areas. By forest-type groups or as a whole, the three species spread slowly at earlier stages, but recently have increased significantly in presence/expansion. Oak/hickory and elm/ash/cottonwood forests were more susceptible to the three invasive shrubs compared to other forests. We recommend that resource managers and planners prescribe control and mitigation treatments for non-native invasive plants by forest types and spatial locations close to highways and residences.

Components mainly related to road traffic, residential heating, biomass burning and secondary inorganic aerosol (ammonium nitrate) reached their highest levels in winter, while mineral dust and marine components were elevated in summer. PMF analysis revealed 7 potential sources. Secondary inorganic aerosol (33%) and biomass burning (33%) are the major contributor in winter followed by EC-primary emissions (16%), aged sulphate (6%), road traffic (7%), fossil fuel combustion (%) and marine aerosol (3%). During summer, these sources account for 12%, 14%, 20%, 22%, 8%, 14% and 10%, respectively. Some PM1 sources are located near the sampling site (residential area, traffic road, industrial area) but a major contribution of long range transport is observed when high pollution events occur.

However, few studies have examined the potential factors that influence housing prices from a big data perspective. In this article, we use a big data perspective to determine the willingness of buyers to pay for various factors. The opinions and geographical preferences of individuals for places can be represented by visit frequencies given different motivations. Check-in data from the social media platform Sina Visitor System is used in this article. Here, we use kernel density estimation (KDE) to analyse the spatial patterns of check-in spots (or places of interest, POIs) and employ the Getis-Ord G(i)(*) method to identify the hot spots for different types of POIs in Shenzhen, China. New indexes are then proposed based on the hot-spot results as measured by check-in data to analyse the effects of these locations on housing prices. This modelling is performed using the hedonic price method (HPM) and the geographically weighted regression (GWR) method. The results show that the degree of clustering of POIs has a signircant influence on housing values. Meanwhile, the GWR method has a better interpretive capacity than does the HPM because of the former method's ability to capture spatial heterogeneity.

In the context of transition from state socialism to capitalism and globalization, huge areas of debris stand as proof of a once flourishing socialist industry forced into controversial cases of privatization and re-privatization. The most important petrochemical plants in Romania have been the object of post-socialist economic restructuring. The reasons are due to the loss of the communist market, the cessation of government subsidies, and the growth of international competition, all in the face of aging production facilities. In the process, more than 30,000 workers were forced into intra-urban or urban-rural migration pushed by an emerging privatized housing market. The authorities acted with secrecy with regard to the process of privatization as well as to the ecological hazards posed by these industrial ruins. Created through a process of industrial decline paired with a general legal framework permeated by neoliberal influences, these urban industrial derelict places have caused hot spots of controversy for urban policies and practices for more than 20 years since the fall of communism in Romania.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Economia",,FOREIGN DIRECT-INVESTMENT;SEGREGATION;GOVERNANCE;ECONOMY;CITIES;EUROPE,,

Industrialization and urbanization were the basic driving factors of URLUT, and local, regional and national social and economic transformation deeply and widely affected its development.

The factors that underlie population declines of reptiles are particularly nebulous, as these are often the least understood class of vertebrates in a given community. In this study, we assess correlations between feeding ecology and phenotypic traits of the Lesser Antillean endemic Dutch leaf-toed gecko, Phyllodactylus martini, along an urban gradient in the Caribbean island of Curacao. There has been a marked decline of this species in developed habitats associated with the invasive tropical house gecko Hemidactylus mabouia. We find a correlation between aspects of locomotor morphology and prey in undeveloped habitats that is absent in developed habitats. Analyses of stomach contents further suggest that Phyllodactylus martini alters primary prey items in developed areas. However, changes in prey promote the overlap in foraging niches between Phyllodactylus martini and Hemidactylus mabouia, suggesting that direct resource competition is contributing to the decline of Phyllodactylus martini. In addition to competitive exclusion, we suggest that the urban extirpation of Phyllodactylus martini could also be attributed to a top-down control on population growth by Hemidactylus mabouia. Colonizations of walls put Phyllodactylus martini in direct contact with Hemidactylus mabouia increasing the chances for predation events, as evidenced by our observation of a predation event on a Phyllodactylus martini juvenile by an adult Hemidactylus mabuoia.

We examined predictors of NO3- removal via the microbial process of denitrification in an urban wetland system in New Jersey, USA with highly heterogeneous soils. Soil cores representing the wide range of soil textures at the site were collected to examine relationships between intact core denitrification rates, denitrification enzyme activity (DEA), available inorganic nitrogen, and soil water retention characteristics. Water retention curves were characterized for pressure potentials ranging from -1 to -5000 cm and used to estimate pore size distribution parameters. The highest intact core denitrification rates occurred in soils located at low elevations, with high macroporosity, and low variability in soil pore radius. High DEA corresponded with high available soil NO3- and high elevation. Soil samples collected at 118 points from the site and analyzed for soil organic matter and texture fractions were used to create interpolated raster layers of properties related to high denitrification rates (""hot spots""). Weighted estimations of whole-site NO3- removal based on denitrification hot spots were higher than site estimations based on average denitrification rates, suggesting that studies using the latter approach may be underestimating NO3- removal at the landscape level. Stormwater channels at the site intersected with denitrification hot spots over 20% of total channel area, indicating that soils may be at least partially reducing total NO3- loads to the adjacent creek. These results show that soil physical properties that are relatively immutable can be used for predicting the location of potential hot spots of microbial activity at the landscape scale.

Micro-level simulation was successfully applied to estimate the emissions on a scale of meters. Two programs were used: i) VISSIM to simulate the traffic on the square and to compute velocity-time profiles; and ii) VERSIT+(micro) through ENVIVER that uses VISSIM outputs to compute the related emissions at vehicle level. Data collection was achieved by a measurement campaign obtaining empirical data of vehicle flows and traffic intensities. Twelve simulations of different traffic situations (scenarios) were conducted, representing different hours from several days in a week and the corresponding NOX and PM10 emissions were estimated. The results show a general reduction on average speeds for higher intensities due to braking-acceleration patterns that contribute to increase the average emission factor and, therefore, the total emissions in the domain, especially on weekdays. The emissions are clearly related to traffic volume, although maximum emission scenario does not correspond to the highest traffic intensity due to congestion and variations in fleet composition throughout the day. These results evidence the potential that local measures aimed at alleviating congestion may have in urban areas to reduce emissions. In general, scenario-average emission factors estimated with the VISSIM-VERSIT+(micro) modelling system fitted well those from the average-speed model COPERT, used as a preliminary validation of the results. The largest deviations between these two models occur in those scenarios with more congestion. The design and resolution of the microscale modelling system allow to reflect the impact of actual traffic conditions on driving patterns and related emissions, making it useful for the design of mitigation measures for specific traffic hot-spots.

The complexity and heterogeneity of the urban environment has made study of specific urban centers vital for urban malaria control programs, whereas more generalizable risk factor identification also remains essential. Ahmedabad city, India, is a large urban center located in the state of Gujarat, which has experienced a significant Plasmodium vivax and Plasmodium falciparum disease burden. Therefore, a targeted analysis of malaria in Ahmedabad city was undertaken to identify spatiotemporal patterns of malaria, risk factors, and methods of predicting future malaria cases. Malaria incidence in Ahmedabad city was found to be spatially heterogeneous, but temporally stable, with high spatial correlation between species. Because of this stability, a prediction method utilizing historic cases from prior years and seasons was used successfully to predict which areas of Ahmedabad city would experience the highest malaria burden and could be used to prospectively target interventions. Finally, spatial analysis showed that normalized difference vegetation index, proximity to water sources, and location within Ahmedabad city relative to the dense urban core were the best predictors of malaria incidence. Because of the heterogeneity of urban environments and urban malaria itself, the study of specific large urban centers is vital to assist in allocating resources and informing future urban planning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA;TRANSMISSION;URBANIZATION;Risk Factors,,

The Toxic Sites Identification Program (TSIP) developed by Pure Earth, a New Yorkebased nongovernmental organization, is the only systematic effort to catalogue contaminated sites globally. To date, TSIP has identified and catalogued 3282 sites in low-and middle-income countries. The TSIP methodology is not designed to survey all contaminated sites in a country. Rather sites are prioritized based on their perceived impact on human health, and only a limited number of the most highly hazardous sites are surveyed. The total number of contaminated sites globally and the fraction of contaminated sites captured by TSIP is not known.        O B J E C T I V E To determine the TSIP site capture rate, the fraction of contaminated sites in a country catalogued by TSIP.        M E T H O D S Ghana was selected for this analysis because it is a rapidly industrializing lower middle income country with a heterogeneous industrial base, a highly urban population (51%), and good public records systems. To develop an estimate of the fraction of sites in Ghana captured by TSIP, assessors targeted randomly selected geographic quadrats for comprehensive assessment using area and population statistics from the Ghana Statistical Service. Investigators physically walked all accessible streets in each quadrat to visually identify all sites. Visual identification was supplemented by field-based confirmation with portable x-ray fluorescence instruments to test soils for metals. To extrapolate from survey findings to develop a range of estimates for the entire country, the investigators used 2 methodologies: a ""bottom-up"" approach that first estimated the number of waste sites in each region and then summed these regional subtotals to develop a total national estimate; and a ""top-down"" method that estimated the total number of sites in Ghana and then allocated these sites to each region. Both methods used cluster random sampling principles.        F I N D I N G S The investigators identified 72 sites in the sampled quadrats. Extrapolating from these findings to the entire country, the first methodology estimated that there are 1561 sites contaminated by heavy metals in Ghana (confidence interval [CI]: 1134-1987), whereas the second estimated 1944 sites (CI: 812-3075). The estimated total number of contaminated sites in Ghana is thus 7-9 times the number of sites captured through TSIP. On a population basis, it was estimated that there are between 31 and 115 contaminated sites per million inhabitants in Ghana.        C O N C L U S I O N S The findings of this study indicate that the TSIP methodology provides a sound statistical basis for policy formulation. The statistical approaches used in this study can be replicated in other countries to improve estimates of the prevalence of contaminated sites. This information provides important input to calculations of the global burden of disease attributable to hazardous exposures at contaminated sites.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,INTEGRATED ASSESSMENT;HEALTH;COMMUNITY;POLLUTION;NIGERIA;GHANA;ACCRA;Prevalence,,

Eight eligible foot beat locations were set by examining crime rates for previous years in order to identify micro-places of high criminal activity. We employed a quasi-experimental design comparing the four treatment to the four control areas, estimating panel-specific autoregressive models for 30 weeks prior to and 40 weeks after the treatment.        Time series models revealed statistically significant reductions in violent crime in the micro-places receiving foot patrol treatment, while no such reductions were observed in the control areas. The deterrent effect, however, was short and dissipated quickly. Control areas did not experience any crime prevention benefit during this time period. No evidence of crime displacement to spatially contiguous areas was detected.

It is acknowledged that the development of multifunctional landscapes can meet the economic, social and ecological needs with minimal living space. This study aims to spatially identify multifunctional landscapes in the Beijing-Tianjin-Hebei region, and to make clear associated influencing factors. Based on the quantification of five landscape functions, the interactions of landscape functions were measured using spearman correlation analysis, and the cold and hot spots of landscape functions were identified through Getis-Ord Gi statistics. Based on spatial overlaying, landscape multifunctionality was assessed in the study area. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was also used to make clear the geographical factors of spatial distribution of multifunctional landscapes. The results showed that regulation functions of landscapes displayed synergies in pairs, whereas human activities had obvious conflicts with natural landscape functions, and multifunctional landscapes covered over two-thirds of the study area, widely distributing in low-elevation areas with gentle slopes. They were located not only with a usually high level of vegetation coverage and low level of urbanization, but also some distance from rivers and highways. According to clustering of landscape functions, four development zones were divided in the study area, i.e. urban assembling area, suburban grain-producing area, ecological barrier area, and rural developing area. Policy-makers should set and implement relevant economic development and ecological protection policies according to landscape function features. (C) 2016 Elsevier Ltd.

Although the role of appropriate urban forms in reducing disaster vulnerability has been recognized for some time, the majority of its potential remains focused on long-term mitigation efforts. In contrast, examination of the relationships with short-term disaster management activities such as response and immediate recovery has not been thoroughly conducted. This paper contributes to this shortfall by analysing a critical type of rapid onset disaster, a near-field tsunami, and the role of urban form in supporting the populations' core response activities of evacuation and sheltering. The Chilean city of Iquique (affected by a severe earthquake and minor tsunami in 2014) is examined using a mixed methods approach that provides the basis for proposed macro-scale and micro-scale changes in its urban form; these modifications, in turn, are assessed with geographic information system (GIS) and agent-based computer models. The results show important existing evacuation vulnerability throughout major areas of the city (as the result of interrelated critical conditions), which nonetheless could be significantly reduced by the changes proposed. Further steps in this iterative process, in turn, could lead to the development of evacuation-based urban design standards capable of being transferred to different tsunami-prone contexts around the world.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,INDONESIA;STRATEGIES;EARTHQUAKE;CITIES;DESIGN;CITY;Chile;Disasters,,

The objective of this study was to determine if endotracheal intubation procedures are more likely to occur at greater distances from the hospital and near clusters of pediatric calls.        Methods: This was a retrospective observational study including all EMS runs for patients less than 18 years of age from 2008 to 2014 in a geographically large and diverse Oregon county that includes densely populated urban areas near Portland and remote rural areas. We geocoded scene addresses using the automated address locator created in the cloud-based mapping platform ArcGIS, supplemented with manual address geocoding for remaining cases. We then use the Getis-Ord Gi spatial statistic feature in ArcGIS to map statistically significant spatial clusters (hot spots) of pediatric EMS runs throughout the county. We then superimposed all intubation procedures performed during the study period on maps of pediatric EMS-run hot spots, pediatric population density, fire stations, and hospitals. We also performed multivariable logistic regression to determine if distance traveled to the hospital was associated with intubation after controlling for several confounding variables.        Results: We identified a total of 7,797 pediatric EMS runs during the study period and 38 endotracheal intubations. In univariate analysis we found that patients who were intubated were similar to those who were not in gender and whether or not they were transported to a children's hospital. Intubated patients tended to be transported shorter distances and were older than non-intubated patients. Increased distance from the hospital was associated with reduced odds of intubation after controlling for age, sex, scene location, and trauma system entry status in a multivariate logistic regression. The locations of intubations were superimposed on hot spots of all pediatric EMS runs. This map demonstrates that most of the intubations occurred within areas where pediatric EMS calls were highly clustered. By mapping the intubation procedures and pediatric population density, we found that intubation procedures were not clustered in a similar distribution to the pediatric population in the county.        Conclusion: In this geographically diverse county the location of intubation procedures was similar to the clustering of pediatric EMS calls, and increased distance from the hospital was associated with reduced odds of intubation after controlling for several potential confounding variables.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,"EMERGENCY MEDICAL-SERVICES;URBAN;CARE;Intubation, Intratracheal",,

This research evaluates five measures to find the most suitable ambient population-at-risk estimate for 'theft from the person' crimes.        Method:        1. Collect 'ambient' datasets: the 2011 Census, aggregate mobile telephone locations, and social media.        2. Correlate the population measures against crime volumes to identify the strongest predictor.        3. Use the G(i)* statistic to identify statistically significant clusters of crime under alternative denominators.        4. Explore the locations of clusters, comparing those that are significant under ambient and residential population estimates.        Results and Discussion: The research identifies the Census workday population as the most appropriate population-at-risk measure. It also highlights areas that exhibit statistically significant rates using both the ambient and residential denominators. This hints at an environmental backcloth that is indicative of both crime generators and attractors - i.e. places that attract large numbers of people for non-crime purposes (generators) as well as places that are used specifically for criminal activity (attractors). Regions that are largely residential and yet only exhibit hotspots under the ambient population might be places with a higher proportion of crime attractors to stimulate crime, but fewer generators to attract volumes of people.

The present research applies local Moran's I as a unique approach to recognize the pattern of statistically significant LST increase by detecting clusters of localized hot spots. The single channel algorithm has been applied to extract LST from nine temporal Landsat datasets ranging from 2001 to 2013. LST difference maps generated with 2001 as the base year have been filtered by local Moran's I at four different spatial weights (90 m, 120 m, 150 m and 200 m) to represent a spatially homogeneous form of LST clusters. Smaller spatial weights are useful to map more localized and specific pattern of urban LST change, whereas larger spatial weights produce a somewhat generalized pattern, useful for studying the coarse scale phenomenon. Integrating LISA clusters to the temperature-vegetation (TVX) feature space validates the hot spots as areas with significant land use transformations in the last decade. Further, the spatial sector-wise concentration of hot spots throughout the time series determines the direction and magnitude of urban expansion. The study provides innovative insights on how the integrated application of local Moran's I on LST change and TVX can be used to delineate the regions of acute land transformation and, in turn, act as a decision-making tool for urban planning.

The present study was conducted to assess the risk of CL, and to determine some epidemiological features of the disease in endemic areas of Qom Province in Central Iran during 2009 to 2013.        Methods        Data regarding human cases of the disease were obtained from the Qom Province Health Center, prepared and stored in a spatial database created in ArcGIS10.3. A total of 9 out of 212 Leishmania spp. positive slides taken in 2013 from patients residing in Qom city were examined using molecular methods and the species of Leishmania was identified by PCR-RFLP. Those 9 patients had no history of travel outside the city. Spatial analysis and clustering methods were applied to find major hot spots and susceptible areas for the establishment of novel foci of the disease. Transmission patterns were examined for spatial autocorrelation using the Moran's / statistical application, and for the clustering of high or low values using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistics.        Results        During the period of study, a total of 1767 CL cases were passively reported in the area, out of which were 65% males and 35% females. The highest and lowest numbers of cases were reported in 2010 and 2013, respectively. Importantly, 979 cases were reported from urban areas, while the remainder came from rural areas. Leishmania major was detected as the causative agent of CL in the city of Qom. Remarkably, most patients recorded in Qom city were associated with a history of travel to the endemic areas of CL within the province, or to other endemic areas of the disease in Iran. Spatial distribution of CL cases revealed northeastern and southwestern quarters of the city were the major hot spots of the disease (P<0.05). Hot spot and CL transmission risk analysis across the province indicated that more than 40 villages were located in high and very high risk areas of CL transmission.        Conclusions        Due to the existence of hot spots (P<0.05) of CL in successive years in some quarters of Qom city, along with detection of L. major from the patients without a history of travel, there may be potential of local transmission of the disease within the city. Therefore, it is necessary to conduct a comprehensive study concerning the hot spots of CL in Qom city for curtailing the incidence of the disease in the city. The methodology and the results of this study is essential in serving as a yardstick for subsequent similar studies that will be carried out in other endemic areas of CL in Iran and providing an adequate tool for the establishment of a national database of cutaneous leishmaniasis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,GEOGRAPHICAL INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;PHLEBOTOMINE SAND FLIES;VISCERAL        LEISHMANIASIS;DIPTERA PSYCHODIDAE;NICHE MODEL;VECTORS;DISEASE;FOCUS;TRANSMISSION;DIAGNOSIS;Iran,,

We investigated how sources, fluxes, and flowpaths of water, carbon (C), nitrogen (N), and phosphorus (P) shift in response to differences in urban stream restoration and sewer infrastructure. We compared an urban restored stream with two urban degraded streams draining varying levels of urban development and one stream with upland stormwater management systems over a 3-year period. We found that there was significantly decreased peak discharge in response to precipitation events following stream restoration. Similarly, we found that the restored stream showed significantly lower (p < 0.05) monthly peak runoff (9.4 +/- 1.0mm day(-1)) compared with two urban degraded streams (ranging from 44.9 +/- 4.5 to 55.4 +/- 5.8mm day(-1)) draining higher impervious surface cover, and the stream-draining stormwater management systems and less impervious surface cover in its watershed (13.2 +/- 1.9 mm day(-1)). The restored stream exported most carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus at relatively lower streamflow than the two more urban catchments, which exported most carbon and nutrients at higher streamflow. Annual exports of total carbon (6.6 +/- 0.5 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)), total nitrogen (4.5 +/- 0.3 kg ha(-1) yr (-1)), and total phosphorus (161 +/- 15 kg ha(-1) yr(-1)) were significantly lower in the restored stream compared to both urban degraded streams (p < 0.05), but statistically similar to the stream draining stormwater management systems, for N exports. However, nitrate isotope data suggested that 55 +/- 1% of the nitrate in the urban restored stream was derived from leaky sanitary sewers (during baseflow), statistically similar to the urban degraded streams. These isotopic results as well as additional tracers, including fluoride (added to drinking water) and iodide (contained in dietary salt), suggested that groundwater contamination was a major source of urban nutrient fluxes, which has been less considered compared to upland sources. Overall, leaking sewer pipes are a problem globally and our results suggest that combining stream restoration with restoration of aging sewer pipes can be critical to more effectively minimizing urban nonpoint nutrient sources. The sources, fluxes, and flowpaths of groundwater should be prioritized in management efforts to improve stream restoration by locating hydrologic hot spots where stream restoration is most likely to succeed.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,DISSOLVED ORGANIC-CARBON;SURFACE-WATER;LAND-USE;WASTE-WATER;FLUORESCENCE SPECTROSCOPY;NITROGEN EXPORT;ARTIFICIAL SWEETENERS;IMPERVIOUS SURFACES;TRANSIENT STORAGE;RIVER RESTORATION;Food,,

Attenuation can occur by tributary dilution, groundwater discharge, and biological processing both in the water column and the hyporheic zone. A wastewater treatment plant on Pennypack Creek, an urban stream near Philadelphia, PA, provided high nitrate concentrations for analysis of downstream attenuation processes. Longitudinal sampling for an 8-km reach revealed decreases in nitrate concentration of 2mgl(-1) at high flow and 4.5mgl(-1) during low flow. During high flow, N-15-NO3 increased from 9.5 to 10.5 parts per thousand and during low flow increased from 10.1 to 11.1 parts per thousand. Two reaches were sampled at fine spatial intervals (approximately 200m) to better identify attenuation processes. Mixing analysis indicated that groundwater discharge and biological processing both control nitrate concentration and isotope signatures. However, fine-scaled sampling did not reveal spatially discrete zones; instead, these processes were occurring simultaneously. While both processes attenuate nitrate, they have opposite isotope signatures, which may have muted changes in N-15-NO3. At high flow, a decrease in Cl/NO3 ratios helped distinguish groundwater discharge occurring along both finely sampled reaches. At low flow, biological processing seemed to be occurring more extensively, but the N-15-NO3 signature was not consistent with either a single process or a sequential combination of groundwater dilution and biological nitrate attenuation.

This is particularly ubiquitous for rare or elusive species, because traffic strikes occur infrequently for these populations and information about localized abundance, distribution and movements are generally lacking. Here, we assessed whether citizen-collected sightings data may serve as a low cost and efficient means of gathering long-term animal roadside presence and road-crossing information, which could then be used to assess the causative factors and direct mitigation actions aimed at reducing wildlife traffic strike frequency. We explored this principle using two decades of traffic strike records and citizen-collected sightings of the southern cassowary Casuarius casuarius johnsonii. Roads have bisected the cassowaries' rain forest habitat and despite considerable investment into mitigation strategies for this species, road-induced mortality is considered one of the primary threatening processes affecting the population. Using a Bayesian approach and controlling for spatial autocorrelation with conditional autoregressive models, we demonstrate that traffic strikes are primarily a density-dependent process in the southern cassowary. That is, traffic strike clusters occurred along stretches of road where cassowaries were most frequently sighted. There were, however, road stretches where traffic strike frequency was greater than predicted by the number of roadside sightings, illustrating when and where density-independent processes increased the mortality potential for a road-crossing cassowary.Synthesis and applications. This is the first time that citizen-collected sightings data have been used to systematically inform upon the abundance and distribution of wildlife traffic strike. The technique not only predicts where incidents are likely to occur but also helps us to understand the factors responsible for strike clustering. While not a replacement for systematic surveys, we highlight citizen-collected sightings data as a low-cost option when assessing contributing factors to vehicle-induced mortality. Accounting for density-dependent and density-independent processes will ensure the most effective allocation of resources when implementing wildlife traffic strike mitigation.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,MOTOR-VEHICLE CRASHES;POISSON-GAMMA;ROADS;CASUALTIES;MORTALITY;MODELS,,

Although source reduction has been shown to be effective in reducing mosquito populations, thousands of backyards need to be inspected during door-to-door campaigns, which is labor intensive and expensive. We identified 'hot spots' as high (five or more female or male Ae. albopictus) adult mosquito populations at very focal locations. We tested whether hot spot source reduction efforts were effective in reducing mosquito populations in the early summer season (June to July).        RESULTS: Analysis of historical data from the study sites indicated the proportion of hot spots in the control site relative to the intervention site was much greater in 2011, when hot spot treatments were applied to the intervention site, than in 2012, 2013 and 2014 combined, when no sites were treated [OR (95% CI) = 3.9 (1.8, 8.5), Z = 3.39, P < 0.001).

We present a method to map the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and to identify the substitutability among nature sites in the context of the province of Antwerp, Belgium. We propose an indicator of substitutability among nature areas, contrasting unique but poorly substitutable sites (hot spots) with highly substitutable sites (cold spots). Using a combination of survey information, public participation GIS (PPGIS) and kernel density mapping, we produce density surfaces representing the distribution of the collective preferences for outdoor recreation and identify the spatial characteristics of the market (e.g. extent, discontinuities) for outdoor recreation. We also compute Getis-Ord G(i)* spatial statistics to identify local outdoor recreation clusters. In addition, we explore how recreational behaviour affects substitutability. Our results suggest a duality between the social value of outdoor recreation and the level of substitutability among nature sites. Highly substitutable sites tend to be found near areas of higher population density, which are as well highly visited sites. The type of recreational activity - hiking, cycling, dog walking or jogging - appears to substantially modify substitutability patterns among nature sites. We conclude by discussing the methodological implications of this research in the context of stated preference ecosystem service valuation and stress several policy -related implications.

The mean radiant temperature (Tmrt) quantifies the effect of the radiation environment on humans, but it can only be estimated based on influencing parameters and factors. Knowledge of Tmrt is important for quantifying the heat load on human beings, especially during heat waves. This study estimates Tmrt using several methods, which are based on climatic data from a traditional weather station, microscale ground surface measurements, land surface temperature (LST) and light detection and ranging (LIDAR) data measured using airborne devices. Analytical results reveal that the best means of estimating Tmrt combines information about 1ST and surface elevation information with meteorological data from the closest weather station. The application in this method can eliminate the inconvenience of executing a wide range ground surface measurement, the insufficient resolution of satellite data and the incomplete data of current urban built environments.

We used multilevel Poisson regression analysis to explain variation in the count of incidents at each address. Place-level proximity to nodes and paths was measured by using the Euclidian distance from each location to the closest carry-out liquor store, on-premises drinking establishment, and bus route. The broader environmental backcloth was represented by various census block-group characteristics, including density of commercial land use. A three-way place-level interaction as well as a cross-level interaction involving all four key independent variables were used to estimate the Brantinghams' concept of the overlay of nodes, paths, and backcloth.        The three-way interaction involving the distance to the closest on-premises liquor establishment, the distance to closest carry-out liquor facility, and the distance to the closest bus route was significantly and negatively related to place-level crime incidents. This three-way interaction had effects which varied across neighborhood contexts, with stronger negative effects on crime occurring in neighborhoods characterized by high levels of commercial density.        This study supported the notion of a multilevel theory of crime places and has implications for more effectively addressing crime. In particular, those places with multiple nodes and paths in their proximal environments and dense commercial land within their broader environments likely need additional crime prevention measures to get the same benefit relative to places with multiple nodes and paths in the proximal environments yet little commercial density within their broader environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,ROUTINE ACTIVITIES;LONGITUDINAL ANALYSIS;URBAN NEIGHBORHOODS;STREET        ROBBERY;HIGH-SCHOOLS;LAND-USE;VICTIMIZATION;PREVENTION;BLOCKS;MODELS;Crime,,

While several studies have been carried out in order to predict the potential limits of the species expansions based on eco-climatic parameters, few studies have so far focused on the specific effects of these variables in shaping its micro-geographic abundance and dynamics. The present study investigated eco-climatic factors affecting Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural sites in Rome (Italy), which was colonized in 1997 and is nowadays one of the most infested metropolitan areas in Southern Europe. To this aim, longitudinal adult monitoring was carried out along a 70 km-transect across and beyond the most urbanized and densely populated metropolitan area. Two fine scale spatiotemporal datasets (one with reference to a 20m circular buffer around sticky traps used to collect mosquitoes and the second to a 300m circular buffer within each sampling site) were exploited to analyze the effect of climatic and socio-environmental variables on Ae. albopictus abundance and dynamics along the transect. Results showed an association between highly anthropized habitats and high adult abundance both in metropolitan and sub-urban/rural areas, with ""small green islands"" corresponding to hot spots of abundance in the metropolitan areas only, and a bimodal seasonal dynamics with a second peak of abundance in autumn, due to heavy rains occurring in the preceding weeks in association with permissive temperatures. The results provide useful indications to prioritize public mosquito control measures in temperate urban areas where nuisance, human-mosquito contact and risk of local arbovirus transmission are likely higher, and highlight potential public health risks also after the summer months typically associated with high mosquito densities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,HOST-FEEDING PATTERNS;DIPTERA-CULICIDAE;URBAN;MOSQUITOS;TIGER;ROME;TEMPERATURE;POPULATIONS;DISPERSAL;DYNAMICS;Aedes,,

This study addresses these challenges by developing an interdisciplinary methodology based on the Procedure for Ecological Tiered Assessment of Risk (PETAR). This novel methodology integrates ecological models with a land-use change model. This study quantifies the multi-dimensional degradation risks of ES in the Taihu Lake Basin (TLB) of China from 1985 to 2020. Four key ES related to water purification, water quantity adjustment, carbon sequestration and grain production are selected. The study employs models of Denitrification-Decomposition (DNDC), Soil-Water-Atmosphere-Plant (SWAP), Biome-BGC and Agro-ecological Zoning (AEZ) for assimilations. Land-use changes by 2020 were projected using a geographically weighted multinomial logit-cellular automata (GWML-CA) model. The results show that rapid land-use change has posed a great degradation risk of ES in the region in 1985-2020. Slightly less than two-thirds of the basin experienced degradation of ES over the 1985-2010 period, and about 12% of the basin will continue to experience degradation until 2020. Hot spots with severe deterioration in 2010-2020 are projected to be centered around some small and less developed cities in the region. Regulating accelerated urban sprawl and population growth, reinforcing current environmental programs, and establishing monitoring systems for observing dynamics of regional ES are suggested as practical counter-measures.

Nevertheless 10% to 12% of the EU-28 urban population was still exposed to benzene concentrations above the WHO reference level of 1.7 mu g/m(3). WHO recommended a wise choice of monitoring stations positioning in proximity of ""hot spots"" to define and assess the representativeness of each site paying attention to micro-scale conditions. In this context benzene and other VOCs of health concern (toluene, ethylbenzene, xylenes) concentrations have been investigated, with weekly passive sampling for one year, both in outdoor and indoor air in inhabited buildings in close proximity (180 m far up to 1100 m) of an integrated steel plant in NE of Italy. Even though the outdoor mean annual benzene concentration was below the EU limit in every site, in the site closest to the works the benzene concentration was above 5 mu g/m(3) in 14 weeks. These events were related to a benzene over toluene ratio above one, which is diagnostic for the presence of an industrial source, and to meteorological factors. These information pointed at the identification of the coke ovens of the plant as the dominant outdoor source of benzene. Benzene gradients with the increasing distance from coke ovens have been found for both outdoor and indoor air. Linear models linking outdoor to indoor benzene concentrations have been then identified, allowing to estimate indoor exposure from ambient air benzene data. In the considered period, a narrow area of about 250 m appeared impacted at a higher degree than the other sites both considering outdoor and indoor air. Passive BTEX sampling permits to collect information on both ambient air and daily life settings, allowing to assemble a valuable data support for further environmental cost-benefit analyses.

Nevertheless, quantitative data regarding the contribution of different densities of built-up surfaces in determining urban spatial LST changes is currently lacking in Italy. This study, which aimed to provide clear and quantitative city-specific information on annual and seasonal spatial LST modifications resulting from increased urban built-up coverage, was conducted generally throughout the whole year, and specifically in two different periods (cool/cold and warm/hot periods). Four cities (Milan, Rome, Bologna and Florence) were included in the study. The LST layer and the built-up-surface indicator were obtained via use of MODIS remote sensing data products (1 km) and a very high-resolution map (5 m) of built-up surfaces recently developed by the Italian National Institute for Environmental Protection and Research. The relationships between the dependent (mean daily, daytime and nighttime LST values) and independent (built-up surfaces) variables were investigated through linear regression analyses, and comprehensive built-up-surface-related LST maps were also developed. Statistically significant linear relationships (p < 0.001) between built-up surfaces and spatial LST variations were observed in all the cities studied, with a higher impact during the warm/hot period than in the cool/cold ones. Daytime and nighttime LST slope patterns depend on the city size and relative urban morphology. If implemented in the existing city plan, the urban maps of built-up-surface-related LST developed in this study might be able to support more sustainable urban land management practices by identifying the critical areas (Hot-Spots) that would benefit most from mitigation actions by local authorities, land-use decision makers, and urban planners.

Degradation of NDMA and its precursor, dimethylamine (DMA), was investigated by adsorbing them from aqueous solution using porous mineral sorbents, followed by destruction under microwave irradiation. Among the mineral sorbents evaluated, dealuminated ZSM-5 exhibited the highest sorption capacities for NDMA and DMA, which decreased with the density of surface cations present in the micropores. In contrast, the degradation rate of the sorbed NDMA increased with the density of surface cations under microwave irradiation. Evolutions of the degradation products and C/N ratio indicate that the sorbed NDMA and DMA could be eventually mineralized under continuous microwave irradiation. The degradation rate was strongly correlated with the bulk temperature of ZSM-5 and microwave power, which is consistent with the mechanism of pyrolysis caused by formation of micro-scale ""hot spots"" within the mineral micropores under microwave irradiation. Compared to existing treatment options for NDMA removal, microporous mineral sorption coupled with microwave-induced degradation has the unique advantages of being able to simultaneously remove NDMA and DMA and cause their full mineralization, and thus could serve as a promising alternative method.

In the present study, to identify the policy implications of inventorying and mapping HM pollution of soil in brownfields throughout China, the Bayan Obo giant rare earth element (REE)-Nb-Fe ore deposit of Baotou in Inner Mongolia, China, which is the largest REE mineral deposit in the world, was taken as a case study. Soil samples from 24 sites in Bayan Obo mining area (MA) and 76 sites in mine tailing area (TA) were collected for determining contents of soil HMs (Cr, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn). The results showed that the average concentrations of Cr, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn in both MA and TA were all higher than their corresponding background values for Inner Mongolia but lower than the Class II criteria of the National Soil Quality Standards of China (GB 15618-1995). Enrichment factor (EF) analysis of the soil samples indicated that the soil in the brownfield sites was highly enriched with Cr, Cd, Pb, Cu, and Zn compared to the corresponding background values. In MA, the EF for Cd was the highest among the studied elements, while in TA, the EF for Cr (3.45) was the highest, closely followed by the EF for Cd (3.34). The potential ecological risk index (RI) indicated a moderate potential ecological risk from the studied HMs in MA and a low potential ecological risk in TA, and the results of RI also suggested that the soil was most heavily polluted by Cd. According to the spatial distribution maps of HM, contamination hot-spots were primarily located near mining-related high-pollution plants.

In total, 53 samples were analyzed for 58 polar organic micropollutants such as selected herbicides, biocides, corrosion inhibitors, stimulants, artificial sweeteners, and pharmaceuticals. Main focus is the application of a proposed wastewater indicator quartet (acesulfame, caffeine, valsartan, and valsartan acid) to detect point sources and contamination hot-spots with untreated and treated wastewater. The derived conclusions are compared with the state of knowledge regarding local land use and infrastructure. The artificial sweetener acesulfame and the stimulant caffeine were used as indicators for treated and untreated wastewater, respectively. In case of a contamination with untreated wastewater the concentration ratio of the antihypertensive valsartan and its transformation product valsartan acid was used to further refine the estimation of the residence time of the contamination. The median/maximum concentrations of acesulfame and caffeine were 5.3/178 ng L-1 and 6.1/522 ng L-1, respectively. Their detection frequency was 100%. Highest concentrations were detected within the urban area of the capital of the island (Mytilene). The indicator quartet in the gulfs of Gera and Kalloni (two semi-enclosed embayments on the island) demonstrated different concentration patterns. A comparatively higher proportion of untreated wastewater was detected in the gulf of Gera, which is in agreement with data on the wastewater infrastructure. The indicator quality of the micropollutants to detect wastewater was compared with electrical conductivity (EC) data. Due to their anthropogenic nature and low detection limits, the micropollutants are superior to EC regarding both sensitivity and selectivity. The concentrations of atrazine, diuron, and isoproturon did not exceed the annual average of their environmental quality standards (EQS) defined by the European Commission.

We made on-road measurements to quantify fine-scale structure of methane and a suite of complementary trace gases across the Los Angeles Basin in June 2013. Enhanced methane levels were observed across the basin but were unevenly distributed in space. We identified 213 methane hot spots from unknown emission sources. We made direct measurements of ethane to methane (C2H6/CH4) ratios of known methane emission sources in the region, including cattle, geologic seeps, landfills, and compressed natural gas fueling stations, and used these ratios to determine the contribution of biogenic and fossil methane sources to unknown hot spots and to local urban background air. We found that 75% of hot spots were of fossil origin, 20% were biogenic, and 5% of indeterminate source. In regionally integrated air, we observed a wider range of C2H6/CH4 values than observed previously. Fossil fuel sources accounted for 58-65% of methane emissions, with the range depending on the assumed C2H6/CH4 ratio of source end-members and model structure. These surveys demonstrated the prevalence of fugitive methane emissions across the Los Angeles urban landscape and suggested that uninventoried methane sources were widely distributed and primarily of fossil origin.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,PIPELINE LEAKS;EMISSIONS;GAS;ETHANE;CALIFORNIA;Los Angeles,,

However, the significance of antifouling paint flakes in the fate and transport of DDT compounds and other organic pollutants in estuarine sediment is yet to be adequately addressed. To fill this knowledge gap, estuarine sediment and paint flakes from cabin and boat surfaces were collected from a fishery base in Guangdong Province of South China and analyzed for DDT compounds. Coarse fractioned samples collected from the vicinity of boat maintenance facilities contained appreciable amounts of colorful particles, which were identified as paint flakes by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy. The highest concentrations of DDXs (sum of DDTs and its metabolites) occurred in the heavy-density (>1.7 g cm(-3)) fraction of coarse-size (200-2000 mu m) sediments from near the boat maintenance facilities, suggesting the importance of paint flakes in the distribution pattern of ""hot spots"" in estuarine sediment. Moreover, the desorption rates of DDT compounds from paint flakes and the heavy-density fraction of coarse-size sediment were both extremely slow. Apparently, unevenly distributed paint flakes in sediment can artificially inflate the sorption capacity of heavy-density sediment for DDT compounds, and therefore can substantially change the environmental fate and behavior of hydrophobic organic chemicals in estuarine sediment. Finally, commonly used source diagnostic indices of DDT compounds were mostly grain-size and density dependent in sediment, as a result of the occurrence of paint flakes, which may strongly compromise the outcome of any source diagnostics efforts.

Our goals were to compare female turtles in a suburban environment to those in an adjacent nature reserve, and to interpret our results relative to a previous study in the same system during an El Nio period of drought from 2006 to 2007. During the wet period, turtles from suburban and nature reserve environments exhibited largely similar movements and use of space, and turtles did not aestivate terrestrially despite prolonged periods of aestivation during the 2006-2007 drought. Additionally, turtles from suburbs had reduced annual survivorship (0.67) compared to turtles in the nature reserve (1.00) during the wet period, which contrasts with previous estimates during drought, when survivorship did not differ between environments. Such a reduction in survivorship for suburban turtles resulted largely from vehicular collisions and may be a consequence of rapid increases in human population (79 %) and traffic volume (76 %) over the eight-year study period. Our study demonstrates that turtle behavior and survivorship can be variable in space and time, and that both urban development and climatic conditions can interact and change relatively quickly to influence important aspects of turtle behavior and population biology.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,FRESH-WATER TURTLE;CHELODINA-LONGICOLLIS TESTUDINATA;LONG-NECKED        TURTLE;ROAD MORTALITY;HOT-SPOTS;SPECIES RICHNESS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;CONSERVATION;MANAGEMENT;LANDSCAPE;Survival Rate;Suburban Population,,

Infection occurs after the ingestion of the bacteria and is usually asymptomatic. In a minority of cases, it causes acute diarrhea and vomiting, which can lead to potentially fatal severe dehydration, especially in the absence of appropriate medical care. Immunity occurs after infection and typically lasts 6-36 months.        Cholera is responsible for outbreaks in many African and Asian developing countries, and caused localised and episodic epidemics in South America until the early 1990s. Haiti, despite its low socioeconomic status and poor sanitation, had never reported cholera before the recent outbreak that started in October 2010, with over 720,000 cases and over 8700 deaths (Case fatality rate: 1.2%) through 8 december 2014. So far, this outbreak has seen 3 epidemic peaks, and it is expected that cholera will remain in Haiti for some time.        Methodology/findings: To trace the path of the early epidemic and to identify hot spots and potential transmission hubs during peaks, we examined the spatial distribution of cholera patients during the first two peaks in Artibonite, the second-most populous department of Haiti. We extracted the geographic origin of 84,000 patients treated in local health facilities between October 2010 and December 2011 and mapped these addresses to 63 rural communal sections and 9 urban cities. Spatial and cluster analysis showed that during the first peak, cholera spread along the Artibonite River and the main roads, and sub-communal attack rates ranged from 0.1% to 10.7%. During the second peak, remote mountain areas were most affected, although sometimes to very different degrees even in closely neighboring locations. Sub-communal attack rates during the second peak ranged from 0.2% to 13.7%. The relative risks at the sub-communal level during the second phase showed an inverse pattern compared to the first phase.        Conclusion/significance: These findings demonstrate the value of high-resolution mapping for pinpointing locations most affected by cholera, and in the future could help prioritize the places in need of interventions such as improvement of sanitation and vaccination. The findings also describe spatio-temporal transmission patterns of the epidemic in a cholera-naive country such as Haiti. By identifying transmission hubs, it is possible to target prevention strategies that, over time, could reduce transmission of the disease and eventually eliminate cholera in Haiti.

The pluvial flood event of August 2011 in Shanghai, China is used for model calibration and simulation. Evolving patterns of inundation (area and depth) are assessed over four time periods (1991, 1996, 2001 and 2011) for the downtown area, given local changes in topography and rates of land subsidence of up to 27 mm/yr. The results show that land subsidence can lead to non-linear response of flood characteristics. However, the impact on flood depths is generally minor (<5 cm) and limited to areas with lowest-lying topographies because of relatively uniform patterns of subsidence and micro-topographic variations at the local scale. Nonetheless, the modelling approach tested here may be applied to other cities where there are more marked rates of subsidence and/or greater heterogeneity in the depressed urban surface.

Our hypothesis was that bladder cancer mortality is associated with distinct environmental and socioeconomic factors with effects varying by region, race and gender.        Materials and Methods: NCI (National Cancer Institute) age adjusted, county level bladder cancer mortality data from 1950 to 2007 were analyzed to identify clusters of increased bladder cancer death using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic. Socioeconomic, clinical and environmental data were assessed using geographically weighted spatial regression analysis adjusting for spatial autocorrelation. County level socioeconomic, clinical and environmental data were obtained from national databases, including the United States Census, CDC (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention), NCHS (National Center for Health Statistics) and County Health Rankings.        Results: Bladder cancer mortality hot spots and risk factors for bladder cancer death differed significantly by gender, race and geographic region. From 1996 to 2007 smoking, unemployment, physically unhealthy days, air pollution ozone days, percent of houses with well water, employment in the mining industry and urban residences were associated with increased rates of bladder cancer mortality (p < 0.05). Model fit was significantly improved in hot spots compared to all American counties (R-2 = 0.20 vs 0.05).        Conclusions: Environmental and socioeconomic factors affect bladder cancer mortality and effects appear to vary by gender and race. Additionally there were temporal trends of bladder cancer hot spots which, when persistent, should be the focus of individual level studies of occupational and environmental factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,DISPARITIES;RISK;ASSOCIATION;HEALTH;TRENDS;DIAGNOSIS;PATTERNS;STAGE;SEX;Urinary Bladder Neoplasms;United States;Urinary Bladder;Neoplasms,,

This phenomenon of urban heat islands (UHI) exists both UHI above and below the ground. These zones are coupled through conductive heat transport. However, the precise process is not sufficiently understood. Using satellite-derived land surface temperature and interpolated groundwater temperature measurements, we compare the spatial properties of both kinds of heat islands in four German cities and find correlations of up to 80%. The best correlation is found in older, mature cities such as Cologne and Berlin. However, in 95% of the analyzed areas, groundwater temperatures are higher than land surface temperatures due to additional subsurface heat sources such as buildings and their basements. Local groundwater hot spots under city centers and under industrial areas are not revealed by satellite-derived land surface temperatures. Hence, we propose an estimation method that relates groundwater temperatures to mean annual land-surface temperatures, building density, and elevated basement temperatures. Using this method, we are able to accurately estimate regional groundwater temperatures with a mean absolute error of 0.9 K.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CLIMATE-CHANGE;GEOTHERMAL-ENERGY;SOIL TEMPERATURES;AIR-TEMPERATURE;GERMANY;CITIES;VALIDATION;FLUXES;CITY;URBANIZATION;Hot Temperature,,

As historically undeveloped landscapes are increasingly converted to urban environments, endemic oak woodland extent is reduced, which underscores the importance of strategic placement and reintroduction of oaks and woodland landscape for the maintenance of biodiversity and reduction of habitat fragmentation. This paper investigated the effects of human urban development on oak species in California by first modeling historical patterns of richness for eight oak tree species using historical map and plot data from the California Vegetation Type Mapping (VTM) collection. We then examined spatial intersections between hot spots of historical oak richness and modern urban and conservation lands and found that impacts from development and conservation vary by both species and richness. Our findings suggest that the impact of urban development on oaks has been small within the areas of highest oak richness but that areas of highest oak richness are also poorly conserved. Third, we argue that current policy measures are inadequate to conserve oak woodlands and suggest regions to prioritize acquisition of conservation lands as well as examine urban regions where previous centers of oak richness were lost as potential frontiers for oak reintroduction. We argue that urban planning could benefit from the adoption of historical data and modern species distribution modelling techniques primarily used in natural resources and conservation fields to better locate hot spots of species richness, understand where habitats and species have been lost historically and use this evidence as incentive to recover what was lost and preserve what still exists. This adoption of historical data and modern techniques would then serve as a paradigm shift in the way Urban Planners recognize, quantify, and use landscape history in modern built environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,BIOCLIMATE ENVELOPE MODELS;SPECIES DISTRIBUTION;CLIMATE-CHANGE;BIODIVERSITY HOTSPOTS;URBAN;ECOLOGY;NICHE;PREDICTION;WOODLANDS;MANAGEMENT;California,,

With buses as probes and examining aggregated bus behavior, contoured speed plots were used to understand the behavior of roadways outside the zone of influence of bus stops. Speed plots were used to discover trends and travel patterns with only a few days' data. Congestion and speed variation were viewed by time of day, and plots helped to indicate delays caused by intersections, crosswalks, or bus stops. This type of information is important to transit authorities looking to improve bus running times and reliability. Congested areas were detected and ranked. Speed plots were used to reevaluate bus stop locations (e.g., near side versus far side) and to identify locations where improvement are needed (e.g., queue jump lanes).

During the summer, the lake is used as a public bathing area, therefore, to better evaluate human impacts, field measurements were carried out in high-use seasons. It was found that the spatial distributions of aqueous lead and zinc differ during the summer and autumn. In summer several Pb and Zn hot-spots were observed, while during autumn spatial distributions of Pb and Zn were rather homogenous throughout the entire lake. Large seasonal differences in spatial distributions of Pb and Zn were found in bottom sediments.

Network safety management (NSM) is an analysis tool typically used on freeways and other inter-urban roads to identify the locations with the highest potential for infrastructure improvements from a safety perspective. A study was done on how this tool could also be used to identify such locations within an urban environment. The area of study was the city of Zurich, Switzerland, and the accident data were for the period 2009 to 2013. The aim was to investigate the application of NSM in urban environments, illustrate it with a real case study, evaluate the results obtained, and test robustness of the results for different input parameters. To do this, georeferenced data were required to have explicit distinctions between the three road network elements used: primary road segments, intersections, and residential zones. On the basis of different accident cost rates, a prioritization of the individual network elements was made. Results show that mostly network elements with numerous conflict points have the highest safety potential. Further tests reveal that traffic volume is the most influential parameter within the model. Additionally, more differentiated cost rates are presented, and a comparison with the road safety tool Black Spot Management is employed to verify the detected accident clusters. The findings are used to make pragmatic recommendations on the use of NSM in an urban context.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Duplicatas",,CRASH INJURY SEVERITIES;ROAD TRAFFIC ACCIDENTS;PERFORMANCE;Switzerland,,

The vulnerability was first assessed on the basis of a social vulnerability index that was constructed using Fuzzy Delphi and analytic hierarchy process methods. Subsequently, the corresponding indicator variables were applied to calculate standardized vulnerability assessment scores by using government data. According to the results of the vulnerability assessment in which T scores were normalized, the distribution of social vulnerabilities varied among the townships. The scores were further analyzed using spatial autocorrelation statistics for spatial clustering of vulnerability distribution. The Local G statistic identified 42 significant spatial association pockets, whereas the Global G statistic indicated no spatial phenomenon of clustering. This phenomenon was verified and explained by applying Moran's I statistics to examine the homogeneity and heterogeneity of spatial associations. Although both statistics were originally designed to identify the existence of spatial clustering, they serve diverse purposes, and the results can be compared to obtain additional insights into the distribution patterns of social vulnerability.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,NATURAL HAZARDS;FUZZY DELPHI;ASSOCIATION;POPULATION;INDICATORS;RISK;Taiwan,,

Therefore, we present the basics of crime mapping and analysis with GIS, the practical use of VGI for routing and describe our contribution within the field of routing solutions. Afterwards, we explore our test data in detail. For the practical use, we simplify all the urban infrastructure information and propose a safety index, which represents the relative safety in the investigation area. Additionally, historical crime hot spots are detected and used as routing obstacles. The arcs in the road network are weighted by our safety index and the historical crime hot spots are introduced as obstacle polygons. We test our safety-aware routing design on Los Angeles (LA) and assume its use during night times. In this regard, from two relatively far away situated origin and destination points, we calculate the least dangerous path and compare it with the calculated shortest path. Vehicle drivers without knowledge about the dangerous areas in the city may use the least dangerous path, which is based on our calculated safety index.

Household interviews and Geographical Information System surveys were performed annually to evaluate risk exposures and environmental transmission sources. We completed annual serosurveys to ascertain leptospiral infection based on serological evidence. Among the 1,730 (86%) individuals who completed at least one year of follow-up, the infection rate was 35.4 (95% CI, 30.7-40.6) per 1,000 annual follow-up events. Male gender, illiteracy, and age were independently associated with infection risk. Environmental risk factors included rat infestation (OR 1.46, 95% CI, 1.00-2.16), contact with mud (OR 1.57, 95% CI 1.17-2.17) and lower household elevation (OR 0.92 per 10m increase in elevation, 95% CI 0.82-1.04). The spatial distribution of infection risk was highly heterogeneous and varied across small scales. Fixed effects in the spatiotemporal model accounted for the majority of the spatial variation in risk, but there was a significant residual component that was best explained by the spatial random effect. Although infection risk varied between years, the spatial distribution of risk associated with fixed and random effects did not vary temporally. Specific ""hot-spots"" consistently had higher transmission risk during study years.        Conclusions/Significance        The risk for leptospiral infection in urban slums is determined in large part by structural features, both social and environmental. Our findings indicate that topographic factors such as household elevation and inadequate drainage increase risk by promoting contact with mud and suggest that the soil-water interface serves as the environmental reservoir for spillover transmission. The use of a spatiotemporal approach allowed the identification of geographic outliers with unexplained risk patterns. This approach, in addition to guiding targeted community-based interventions and identifying new hypotheses, may have general applicability towards addressing environmentally-transmitted diseases that have emerged in complex urban slum settings.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,RATS RATTUS-NORVEGICUS;ENVIRONMENT;EPIDEMIC;OUTBREAK;INTERROGANS;INFECTION;GENETICS;SALVADOR;DISEASE;DENGUE;Cohort Studies;Brazil,,

A spatial-network analysis method is employed to track changes in accessibility within the urban street layout over time. The results provide evidence that changes in urban configuration are statistically associated with housing market changes. As the city's road grid changes through suburban expansion, new highways and internal adaptation, changes in relative accessibility follow, both locally and throughout the whole city. Generally, improved accessibility leads to higher property prices as expected. But we also find a negative relationship where new congestion hot spots are created and we identify several types of systemic spill-over effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Economia",,PROPERTY-VALUES;RAPID-TRANSIT;ACCESSIBILITY;IMPACT;TRANSPORT;DYNAMICS;LINE;China,,

Until now, modelling the transport of such debris has largely been restricted to the large-scales of open seas. We used oceanographic modelling to identify potential sites of debris accumulation along a rugged coastline with headlands, islands, rocky coasts and beaches. Our study site was the Great Barrier Reef World Heritage Area that has an emerging problem with debris accumulation. We found that the classical techniques of modelling the transport of floating debris models are only moderately successful due to a number of unknowns or assumptions, such as the value of the wind drift coefficient, the variability of the oceanic forcing and of the wind, the resuspension of some floating debris by waves, and the poorly known relative contribution of floating debris from urban rivers and commercial and recreational shipping. Nevertheless the model was successful in reproducing a number of observations such as the existence of hot spots of accumulation. The orientation of beaches to the prevailing wind direction affected the accumulation rate of debris. The wind drift coefficient and the exact timing of the release of the debris at sea affected little the movement of debris originating from rivers but it affected measurably that of debris originating from ships. It was thus possible to produce local hotspot maps for floating debris, especially those originating from rivers. Such modelling can be used to inform local management decisions, and it also identifies likely priority research areas to more reliably predict the trajectory and landing points of floating debris.

The principal drinking water sources in Pakistan, i.e. ground and surface water, are subject to geogenic and anthropogenic trace metal contamination. However, water quality monitoring activities have been limited to a few administrative areas and a nationwide human health risk assessment from trace metal exposure is lacking. Using geographically weighted regression (GWR) and eight relevant spatial predictors, we calculated nationwide human health risk maps by predicting the concentration of 10 trace metals in the drinking water sources of Pakistan and comparing them to guideline values. GWR incorporated local variations of trace metal concentrations into prediction models and hence mitigated effects of large distances between sampled districts due to data scarcity. Predicted concentrations mostly exhibited high accuracy and low uncertainty, and were in good agreement with observed concentrations. Concentrations for Central Pakistan were predicted with higher accuracy than for the North and South. A maximum 150-200 fold exceedance of guideline values was observed for predicted cadmium concentrations in ground water and arsenic concentrations in surface water. In more than 53% (4 and 100% for the lower and upper boundaries of 95% confidence interval (CI)) of the total area of Pakistan, the drinking water was predicted to be at risk of contamination from arsenic, chromium, iron, nickel and lead. The area with elevated risks is inhabited by more than 74 million (8 and 172 million for the lower and upper boundaries of 95% CI) people. Although these predictions require further validation by field monitoring, the results can inform disease mitigation and water resources management regarding potential hot spots.

The two most important preconditions for the applicability of ATES are favorable climatic conditions and the availability of a suitable aquifer. This paper shows how these two preconditions can be combined to identify where in the world ATES potential is present, or will become present as a consequence of climate change. Countries and regions are identified where regulation and stimulation measures may increase application of ATES technologies and thus help reduce CO2-emissions.        Two types of data determine ATES suitability, and their combination with a 3rd identifies potential hot-spots in the world: 1) geo-hydrological conditions, 2) current and projected climate classification and 3) urbanization. Our method combines the data into an ATES-suitability score as explained in this paper. On the one hand the results confirm the suitability for ATES where it is already applied and on the other they identify places where the technology is or will become suitable. About 15% of urban population lived in areas with high potential for ATES at the start of the 21st century, but this figure will decrease to about 5% during the 21st century as a consequence of expected climate change. Around 50% of urban population currently lives in areas of medium ATES suitability, a percentage that will remain constant.

With the increasing popularity of social networking tools and their video upload/download applications, as well as the connectivity enhancements in wireless networks, it has become a second nature for mobile users to access on-demand content on-the-go. Urban hot spots, usually implemented via wireless relays, answer the bandwidth need of those users. On the other hand, the same popular contents are usually acquired by a large number of users at different times, and fetching those from the initial content source each and every time makes inefficient use of network resources. In-network caching provides a solution to this problem by bringing contents closer to the users. Although in-network caching has been previously studied from latency and transport energy minimization perspectives, energy-efficient schemes to prolong user equipment lifetime have not been considered. To address this problem, we propose the cache-at-relay (CAR) scheme, which utilizes wireless relays for in-network caching of popular contents with content access and caching energy minimization objectives. CAR consists of three integer linear programming models, namely, select relay, place content, and place relay, which respectively solve content access energy minimization, joint minimization of content access and caching energy, and joint minimization of content access energy and relay deployment cost problems. We have shown that place relay significantly minimizes the content access energy consumption of user equipments, while place content provides a compromise between the content access and the caching energy budgets of the network.

The paper was not limited to modeling spatially varying linkages but also drew attention to the local anthropogenic influential factors that shape land-water relations. We employed geographically weighted regression to examine the relationships between urban expansion (measured by land use change intensity) and water quality changes (focusing on six water quality indicators) in a recently fast-growing Chinese city, Lianyungang. Specifically, we analyzed how the local characteristics including urbanization level, environmental management, industrial zone expansion, and land use composition, attributed to the varying responses of water quality changes. Results showed that urbanization level significantly affects land-water linkages. Remarkable water quality improvement was accompanied by urbanization in highly developed watersheds, primarily due to strong influence from extensive water management practices (particularly for COD, BOD, NH3-N, and TP). By contrast, water qualities of less-urbanized watersheds were more sensitive and negatively responsive to land use changes. Clustering industrial activities acted as distinct contributor to Hg contamination, while boosted organic pollution control in highly urbanized areas. The approach proposed in the study can locate and further zoom into the hot-spots of human-water interactions, thereby contributing to better solutions for mitigating undesirable impacts of urbanization on water environment.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,GEOGRAPHICALLY WEIGHTED REGRESSION;LAND-USE PATTERNS;SURFACE-WATER;TEMPORAL VARIATIONS;COVER CHANGE;CHINA;URBANIZATION;RIVER;POLLUTION;IMPACTS,,

The stress concentration factors (SCFs) are the main parameters in the fatigue behavior analysis of negative large eccentricity tubular N-joints. Four negative large eccentricity tubular N-joints specimens were separately tested for calibration and verification of finite element analysis models by considering axial compression in vertical brace case. All experimental joints were simply hinge supported at one end of chord and inclined brace end. Elastic gradient strain distributions along the intersection of joints were measured. Strain concentration factors (SNCFs) at hot spots including saddle and crown points were computed taking advantage of an extrapolation approach. As eccentricity decreased, the position of maximum SCF moved from the saddle point to the crown point at the inclined brace and vertical brace intersection near the vertical brace or the inclined brace. The maximum SCF at the chord and inclined brace intersection near the chord or the inclined brace occurred on the crown point. For the FE analysis, solid elements and certain mesh size were used to model the N-joints. Effects of brace diameter to chord diameter ratio (beta), chord diameter to thickness of chord ratio (2 gamma), brace wall thickness to chord wall thickness ratio (tau) and eccentricity ratio (epsilon) on the SCFs distribution of the negative large eccentricity tubular N-joints were numerically investigated. SCF linearly increased with the increase of eccentricity ratio at the inclined brace and vertical brace intersection near inclined brace and at chord and inclined brace intersection near inclined brace. The effect of eccentricity ratio on SCF equations of small eccentricity tubular N-joints was not considered in current code.

One month long measurements of UFP levels have been monitored and used for the need of this study. We applied a three dimensional computational fluid dynamic (CFD) model based on real measurements for the simulation of UFP levels. We used infiltration factors, evaluated on a daily basis for the under study area, to estimate the indoor UFP levels. As a result the intake fraction for the pedestrians, residents and office workers is in the range of (1E-5)-(1E-4). The street canyon is mostly residential justifying partially the higher value of intake fraction for residents (1E-4). The above iF value is on the same order of magnitude with the corresponding one evaluated in a relative street canyon study. The total iF value in this microenvironment is one order of magnitude higher than ours, explained partially by the different use and activities. Two specific applications of iF to assess prioritization among emission sources and environmental justice issues are also examined. We ran a scenario with diesel and gasoline cars and diesel fueled vehicle seems to be a target source to improve overall iF. Our application focus on a small residential area, typical of urban central Athens, in order to evaluate high resolution iF.

However, to date, there has not been a systematic review of the extent to which the results of vulnerability mapping studies have been applied in decision-making. Accordingly we undertook a comprehensive review of 37 recently published papers that use geospatial techniques for assessing human vulnerability to heat. In addition, we conducted an anonymous survey of the lead authors of the 37 papers in order to establish the level of interaction between the researchers as science information producers and local authorities as information users. Both paper review and author survey results show that heat vulnerability mapping has been used in an attempt to communicate policy recommendations, raise awareness and induce institutional networking and learning, but has not as yet had a substantive influence on policymaking or preventive action.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CLIMATE-CHANGE;DECISION-MAKING;SOCIAL VULNERABILITY;URBAN        VULNERABILITY;ADAPTIVE CAPACITY;EXTREME HEAT;HEALTH-RISK;MORTALITY;STRESS;INDEX;Hot Temperature,,

Persistent organic pollutant (POP) (i.e., PAHs, PCBs, PBDEs, and OCPs) concentrations were measured on fine (d(p) < 2.5 mu m) and coarse (2.5 mu m < d(p) < 10 mu m) aerosol samples collected at two (Urban and Industrial) sites in Izmir, Turkey. POP concentrations were similar to 2 times higher at the Industrial site due to the local sources (i.e., scrap processing iron-steel plants, ship-breaking activities, a petroleum refinery, and a petrochemical plant) that were recently shown to be hot spots emitting these pollutants. The size distribution of particle-phase POPs indicated that they were mostly (> 50%) associated with fine PM. The larger contribution of all POP compounds to fine PM could be attributed to the higher sorption capacity of fine PM because of its relatively higher organic matter content compared to coarse PM. Fine PM fraction of POPs significantly increased with octanol-air partition coefficient (K-OA) (p < 0.01) since larger K-OA values favor the partitioning of POPs to PM. Relationships between fine PM percent and meteorological parameters (i.e., temperature and wind speed) were also investigated. Fine PM percent decreased with temperature and the correlations were significant for 51% of the compounds (p < 0.01), suggesting that the decrease in K-OA with increasing temperature results in less partitioning to PM. Fine PM fraction also decreased with wind speed (p < 0.01 for the 52% of the compounds) that could be attributed to increased resuspension of contaminated coarse particles with increasing wind speed. Using the experimental deposition velocities reported for several POPs in the study area it was shown that dry particle deposition velocity significantly decreases with increasing fine PM fraction (p < 0.01). This indicates that the increase in fine fraction of POPs with decreasing volatility may have important implications for their environmental fate and transport.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;POLYBROMINATED DIPHENYL ETHERS;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS;AIR-WATER EXCHANGE;ORGANOCHLORINE        PESTICIDES OCPS;AEROSOL-SIZE DISTRIBUTIONS;DIBENZO-P-DIOXINS;DRY        DEPOSITION;AMBIENT AIR;PARTICULATE MATTER,,

For this reason field measurement of volume-specific magnetic susceptibility (kappa) was conducted in forest topsoil on the area of study. The measurements were performed twice: directly on the surface and after removal of forest litter to see the influence of the litter on the magnetic signal measured on the soil surface. The maps of surface distribution of kappa value revealed that magnetic anomalies were observed 2.0 km around the residential areas dominated by low emission sources, 2.1 km around the coke plant, 2.8 km around the old steelworks, 1.4 km around the coal-mining waste heaps, and 4.0 km around the combined heat and power plant and coal mines. On the 43% of the study area, the topsoil magnetic susceptibility was between 50 and 100 x 10(-5) SI units; on the 5.2% of the area, kappa value was between 100 and 200 x 10(-5) SI units; and on the 1.2% of the research area, the kappa value was over 200 x 10(-5) SI units. Also the vertical distribution of technogenic magnetic particles (TMPs) along the topsoil profile was analysed using topsoil 30 cm cores. Two kappa value maxima were observed in the soil profile. The upper one (kappa(average) = 333.9 x 10(-5) SI units) was found in either the Oa or Ah subhorizons at the depth of 3 cm to 8 cm dependently of thickness of organic horizon. The lower one (kappa(average) = 53.4 x 10(-5) SI units) was observed in the B or C horizon at the depth of 19 cm to 23 cm. The upper maxima was of anthropogenic origin with large content of the magnetic fraction (magnetic spherules), whereas the lower maxima containing isometric crystals of iron oxides was of pedogenic or geogenic origin. The soil magnetometry seems to be a useful tool in identification of anthropogenic ""hot spots"" caused by industrial and urban dust deposition from different emission sources. (C) 2015 Elsevier B.V.

Identifying geographic patterns in hospitalization rates across small geographic areas could be particularly relevant to targeted patient-level and population-level health care.        OBJECTIVE To determine whether lower respiratory tract infection hospitalization rates varied geographically across a single county and whether such variability was associated with socioeconomic conditions.        DESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS Cross-sectional, population-based study of children hospitalized at one institution for lower respiratory tract infections between January 1, 2010, and December 31, 2013. The setting was Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center, a large, academic, stand-alone pediatric facility located in Hamilton County, Ohio. During the study period, 99.6% of in-county children hospitalized for lower respiratory tract infections were admitted to Cincinnati Children's Hospital Medical Center. Participants were children younger than 2 years who were hospitalized with bronchiolitis and children younger than 18 years who were hospitalized with pneumonia. Patients were identified using discharge diagnosis codes and then geocoded to their home census tract.        EXPOSURES Primary exposures, linked to each geocoded patient, included census tract-level socioeconomic measures obtained from the 2008 to 2012 American Community Survey (eg, adult educational attainment, unemployment, and poverty). Patient-level variables examined included demographics, presence of a complex chronic condition, length of stay, and cost.        MAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES We calculated bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalization rates for Hamilton County and for each of 222 in-county census tracts. Associations between hospitalization rate quintiles and underlying socioeconomic conditions were assessed using the Kruskal-Wallis test. Geographic clustering was assessed using the Getis-Ord Gi* statistic.        RESULTS There were 1495 bronchiolitis hospitalizations and 1231 pneumonia hospitalizations during the study period. The county rates were 17.5 (range across census tracts, 0-71.4) hospitalizations per 1000 children per year for bronchiolitis and 1.6 (range across census tracts, 0-4.3) hospitalizations per 1000 children per year for pneumonia. There was significant variation in the median hospitalization rates by census tract quintile for bronchiolitis (32.8, 20.8, 14.0, 10.4, and 5.1 per 1000) and for pneumonia (3.3, 2.1, 1.4, 0.9, and 0.3 per 1000). There were also significant, graded differences in socioeconomic measures by hospitalization rate quintile. Hot spots were localized to inner- city, impoverished neighborhoods.        CONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE Bronchiolitis and pneumonia hospitalization rates varied considerably in ways that were related to underlying socioeconomic conditions. Clinical and public health interventions, targeted accordingly, could improve patient- level and population-level management of acute conditions at a reduced cost.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,DISPARITIES GEOCODING PROJECT;COMPLEX-CHRONIC-CONDITIONS;SOCIOECONOMIC        MEASURES;EMERGENCY-DEPARTMENT;PNEUMOCOCCAL DISEASE;UNITED-STATES;HEALTH;PNEUMONIA;CHILDREN;BRONCHIOLITIS;Respiratory Tract Infections;Respiratory System,,

Social determinants of health may be substantially affected by spatial factors, which together may explain the persistence of health inequities. Clustering of possible sources of negative health and social outcomes points to a spatial focus for future interventions. We analyzed the spatial clustering of sex work businesses in Southern California to examine where and why they cluster. We explored economic and legal factors as possible explanations of clustering.        Methods. We manually coded data from a website used by paying members to post reviews of female massage parlor workers. We identified clusters of sexually oriented massage parlor businesses using spatial autocorrelation tests. We conducted spatial regression using census tract data to identify predictors of clustering.        Results. A total of 889 venues were identified. Clusters of tracts having higher-than-expected numbers of sexually oriented massage parlors (""hot spots"") were located outside downtowns. These hot spots were characterized by a higher proportion of adult males, a higher proportion of households below the federal poverty level, and a smaller average household size.        Conclusion.

However, a key challenge relates to the absence of spatially disaggregated national accounts data in particular, the absence of GDP data for sub-national administrative units and individual cities. The absence of such data limits the scope for detailed empirical analysis of spatial patterns of economic growth, particularly across individual urban settlements or cities. This paper aims to test the suitability of DMSP-OLS Nighttime Lights (NTL) data as a proxy for GDP to analyze detailed spatial patterns of urban economic growth across South Asia over the period 1999 -2010. It will help to build an understanding of the nature and heterogeneity of spatial patterns of urban economic growth within the region and contribute to the development of a framework for the usage of NTL to investigate such patterns. Geographic Information System (GIS) is employed to identify the cities and urban agglomerations together with their NTL data in South Asia, and spatial statistics are used to analyze the spatial and temporal patterns of NTL growth. This paper adopts descriptive and inferential statistics to determine the quantitative relationship between NTL and population, urban size, and proximity to the coast. This paper reveals that the inter-annually calibrated Nil data is a good proxy for changes in national and sub-national GDP. In South Asia, the urban NIL hot spots are around major cities with populations between 1.3 and 2.6 million in 1999 and 0.5 to 13 million in 2010. Cities in the region have also become more clustered and connected forming urban agglomerations. NTL per unit of land in such clusters tends to be higher than in single cities in South Asia. India, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka tend to have higher NTL (economic) growth on average, while Nepal and Bangladesh have lower growth or declining NTL. There exists a very strong positive linear relation between distance to the coast and the total NIL within that distance, which leads to similar NTL growth rates among inland and coastal cities.

Spatial analysis using geographic information systems (GIS) can assist in identifying high-risk populations and regional differences in efficacy of stroke care. The aim of this study was to identify and locate geographic clusters of high or low rates of stroke, risk factors, and in-hospital mortality across a provincial health care network in Alberta, Canada. Methods: This study employed a spatial epidemiological approach using population-based hospital administrative data. Getis-Ord Gi* and Spatial Scan statistics were used to identify and locate statistically significant ""hot"" and ""cold"" spots of stroke occurrence by type, risk factors, and in-hospital mortality. Results: Marked regional variations were found. East central Alberta was a significant hot spot for ischemic stroke (relative risk [RR] 1.43, p<0.001), transient ischemic attack (RR 2.25, p<0.05), and in-hospital mortality (RR 1.50, p<0.05). Hot spots of intracerebral hemorrhage (RR 1.80, p<0.05) and subarachnoid hemorrhage (RR 1.64, p<0.05) were identified in a major urban centre. Unexpectedly, stroke risk factor hot spots (RR 2.58, p<0.001) were not spatially associated (did not overlap) with hot spots of ischemic stroke, transient ischemic attack, or in-hospital mortality. Conclusions: Integration of health care administrative data sets with geographic information systems contributes valuable information by identifying the existence and location of regional disparities in the spatial distribution of stroke occurrence and outcomes. Findings from this study raise important questions regarding why regional differences exist and how disparities might be mitigated.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,CARE;Hospital Mortality;Information Systems,,

The objectives of this study are to (i) analyze the spatio-temporal patterns of RHLT, and (ii) detect the underlying driving forces and mechanism of RHLT in Bohai Rim during 2000-2010. To achieve these goals, we collected and rasterized high resolution Landsat TM data, socio-economic and physical environmental data for the Bohai Rim. Spatial econometric regression models at both grid scale and county scale were developed to examine the driving forces of RHLT in Bohai Rim. The results indicated that the distribution of rural housing land was characterized by vertical zonality, i.e., the proportion of rural housing land decreased gradually with the increase of elevation, and was more sensitive to slope than to elevation. The results of hot spots analysis showed that the spatial mismatch of rural housing land change and rural population migration made the regional differences of RHLT more remarkable, based on which four rural housing land consolidation regional types were differentiated. The authors argue that towns are effective hubs for linking the urban system and rural system, and it is better to get the farmers to migrate to towns instead of big cities in the process of pushing forward China's new-type urbanization in the future. For this, it is necessary to further improve related system and institution. Only by this way can the relationship between out-migrated farmers and rural housing land be orderly and completely removed, so as to smoothly pushing forward rural housing land consolidation.

Reasons for this increase have not been established. Geostatistics and geographic information system (GIS) tools have emerged as powerful geospatial technologies to identify disease clusters, map patterns and trends, and assess the impact of ecological and socioeconomic factors (SES) on the spatial distribution of diseases. In this study, these tools were used to analyze thyroid cancer incidence in a rural population. Methods: Thyroid cancer incidence and socio-demographic factors in Vermont (VT), United States, between 1994 and 2007 were analyzed by logistic regression and geospatial and temporal analyses. Results: The thyroid cancer age-adjusted incidence in Vermont (8.0 per 100,000) was comparable to the national level (8.4 per 100,000), as were the ratio of the incidence of females to males (3.1:1) and the mortality rate (0.5 per 100,000). However, the estimated annual percentage change was higher (8.3 VT; 5.7 U.S.). Incidence among females peaked at 30-59 years of age, reflecting a significant rise from 1994 to 2007, while incidence trends for males did not vary significantly by age. For both females and males, the distribution of tumors by size did not vary over time; 1.0cm, 1.1-2.0cm, and >2.0cm represented 38%, 22%, and 40%, respectively. In females, papillary thyroid cancer (PTC) accounted for 89% of cases, follicular (FTC) 8%, medullary (MTC) 2%, and anaplastic (ATC) 0.6%, while in males PTC accounted for 77% of cases, FTC 15%, MTC 1%, and ATC 3%. Geospatial analysis revealed locations and spatial patterns that, when combined with multivariate incidence analyses, indicated that factors other than increased surveillance and access to healthcare (physician density or insurance) contributed to the increased thyroid cancer incidence. Nine thyroid cancer incidence hot spots, areas with very high normalized incidence, were identified based on zip code data. Those locations did not correlate with urban areas or healthcare centers. Conclusions: These data provide evidence of increased thyroid cancer incidence in a rural population likely due to environmental drivers and SES. Geospatial modeling can provide an important framework for evaluation of additional associative risk factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,INCREASING INCIDENCE;UNITED-STATES;SOCIOECONOMIC-STATUS;RISK-FACTORS;TRENDS;EPIDEMIOLOGY;SURVEILLANCE;RADIATION;NATION;IMPACT;Thyroid Neoplasms;Rural Population;Thyroid Gland,,

This article distinguishes between public and private disorder, arguing that large-scale administrative data provide new opportunities to examine broken windows theory and alternative models of neighborhood change.        Method: We apply an ecometric methodology to two databases from Boston: 1,000,000+ 911 dispatches and indicators of physical disorder from 200,000+ requests for nonemergency services. Both distinguish between disorder in public and private spaces. A cross-lag longitudinal analysis was conducted using two full years of data (2011-2012).        Results: The two databases provided six dimensions of physical and social disorder and crime. The cross-lag model revealed eight pathways by which one form of disorder or crime in 2011 predicted a significant increase in another in 2012. Although traditional interpretations of broken windows emphasize the role of publicdisorder, private conflict most strongly predicted future crime.

Sealed area rate and construction age are two main factors affecting the urban soil NAC. However, their roles are opposite. It would take dozens of years to reach the maximum soil NAC by soil self-recovery. The spatial distribution of NAC in Beijing built-up area resembled the age of urbanization. Regional hot spots of NAC corresponded to the land use distribution and the urbanization progress in Beijing city. The developed index can be used to assess the impacts of urbanization on soil ecosystem services of natural attenuation of contaminants. (C) 2015 Elsevier Inc.

Considering the substantial number of short-distance trips, the time consumed in traffic jams, the higher costs for parking vehicles and restrictions in central business districts, many commuters have found that non-motorized modes of transportation serve as viable and economical transport alternatives. Thus, local governments should encourage and stimulate non-motorized modes of transportation. In return, governments must provide safe conditions for these forms of transportation, and motorized vehicle users must respect and coexist with pedestrians and cyclists, which are the most vulnerable users of the transportation system. Although current trends in sustainable transport aim to encourage and stimulate non-motorized modes of transportation that are socially more efficient than motorized transportation, few to no safety policies have been implemented regarding vulnerable road users (VRU), mainly in large urban centers. Due to the spatial nature of the data used in transport-related studies, geospatial technologies provide a powerful analytical method for studying VRU safety frameworks through the use of spatial analysis. In this article, spatial analysis is used to determine the locations of regions that are characterized by a concentration of traffic accidents black zones) involving VRU injuries and casualties) in Sao Paulo, Brazil developing country), and Rome, Italy developed country).

More transgressions were observed at the crossings located in more populated suburbs in close proximity to large shopping centres and school zones, whereas the smallest number of transgressions were observed at the least populated locations. In addition to characteristics associated with the larger socio-economic area, the patterns of transgression could be associated with the properties of the existing safety equipment and the design of each level crossing (i.e. location of the platforms, number of rail tracks). Indeed, the largest number of crossed unoccupied but ""at risk"" rail tracks (where a train could have passed), was observed at the crossing with the least transgressions.

BB emits specific organic tracers such as levoglucosan, mannosan, and galactosan, which are produced by pyrolysis of cellulose and hemicellulose and then transported downwind to the western North Pacific by westerly winds. Here we present long-term observations of BB tracers over the remote Chichijima Island in the western North Pacific (WNP) from 2001 to 2013. Elevated concentrations of BB tracers by an order of magnitude were found in midautumn to midspring with winter maxima, which are strongly involved with the atmospheric transport by westerly winds from the Asian continent to the WNP, as supported by backward trajectory analyses. Throughout the observations, we found an increase in the averaged concentrations of BB tracers from 2006 to 2013, which is mainly caused by enhanced BB events in Asian urban and rural areas, as supported by enhanced fire/hot spots in East Asia via satellite images. We also found that the period of the high concentrations was prolonged from 2006 to 2013. Comparison between monthly averaged concentrations of BB tracers and backward air mass trajectories clearly demonstrates that the winter/spring maxima over Chichijima are involved with the seasonal shifting of atmospheric circulation followed by downwind transport of BB aerosols to the WNP. High abundances of BB tracers over the WNP indicate that BB-laden air masses can be transported to remote marine environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ATMOSPHERIC PARTICULATE MATTER;LONG-RANGE TRANSPORT;AIR-POLLUTION;TERRESTRIAL BIOMARKERS;DICARBOXYLIC-ACIDS;SEASONAL-VARIATION;MARINE        AEROSOLS;ISOTOPE RATIOS;SMOKE AEROSOL;JEJU ISLAND;Burns;Aerosols;Asian Continental Ancestry Group,,

The study revealed a fine-scale, street-address-level space-time signature for each type of crime. Drugs and robbery formed stable space-time hotspots in specific locations, highlighting their recurrent nature. Burglary was characterised by a small set of short-term outbursts across space and time, and vehicle thefts showed little sign of concentrations. Comparing these results against their spatial signature helped identify different types of hotspots such as persistent warm spots and a hotspot consisting of a short-term outburst.The result demonstrates the significance of the street-level analysis from the microscopic perspective, which can help form a more focused policing tactic.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,FALSE DISCOVERY RATE;URBAN-CRIME;HOT-SPOTS;PATTERNS;STREET;LEVEL;BURGLARY;NEIGHBORHOODS;TRAJECTORIES;PREVENTION;Chicago;Crime,,

In this two-tier heterogeneous network (HetNet) where femtocells coexist with macrocell, the FAPs may spatially reuse the spectrum assigned to macrocell base station in an unplanned way and the mitigation of the generated co-channel interference becomes a major challenge. The problem is more severe with FAPs operating in a closed access mode, particularly in urban and sub-urban environment. In this work, the impact of interference in downlink on quality of service to macro user and femto user is analyzed by modeling the Signal-to-Interference and Noise Ratio and achieved user throughput. Simulation results show significant reduction of achieved user throughput and creation of coverage holes because of interference. It is clear that the performance of restricted access FAPs under co-channel operation need to be explicitly accounted for and optimized against both cross-tier and co-tier interference.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,ALLOCATION;MITIGATION;AVOIDANCE,,

Potential measures to mitigate the nitrogen and phosphorus loads to the water system can then be efficiently evaluated. The combination of these two methods reveals the overall nutrient load as well as local ""hot spots."" This allows possible mitigation measures to be discussed with regard to their spatial location. This approach goes beyond previous work in which mathematical material flow analysis was shown to be a useful tool to investigate sources of nutrients regardless of their location. The results show that the main sources contributing nutrients to waterways are aquaculture, such as shrimp, tilapia, catfish, and sea bass farming, as well as rice paddies along the main river. Additional sources contributing nutrients to this basin are field crops, livestock, aquaculture, households, and industry. High levels of nutrient inflows come from feeds and fertilizers through aquaculture and rice cultivation. The excess nutrients run into the waterways by direct discharge from aquaculture and runoff processes from rice paddies.

Four research questions are addressed: (1) How do robberies cluster within certain behavior settings? (2) How are conclusions about robbery's behavior settings influenced by the distance interval used to measure the proximate environment? (3) Are dominant behavior settings homogeneous across patrol districts? and (4) Is there temporal variability among dominant behavior settings?        Method: Conjunctive analysis of case configurations is used to construct configural behavior settings around 453 robbery locations in Henderson, Nevada, between 2007 and 2009.        Results: The major findings of this study are that (1) the majority of personal robberies occur within a small number of dominant configural behavior settings and (2) the composition of behavior settings and the proportion of incidents for which they account varies by the distance interval used to measure the proximate environment, patrol district, and time of day.

Although in nitrite containing leachates' N removal efficiencies also reached to similar to 60%, their emitted N2O comprised similar to 40% of total removed nitrogen.

We carried out mobile measurements in a car for size resolved particle number concentrations (PNCs) in the 5-560 nm range under five different ventilation settings on a 6 km long busy round route with 10 TIs. These ventilation settings were windows fully open and both outdoor air intake from fan and heating off (Set(1)), windows closed, fan 25% on and heating 50% on (Set(2)), windows closed, fan 100% on and heating off (Set(3)), windows closed, fan off and heating 100% on (Set(4)), and windows closed, fan and heating off (Set(5)). Measurements were taken sequentially inside and outside the car cabin at 10 Hz sampling rate using a solenoid switching system in conjunction with a fast response differential mobility spectrometer (DMS50). The objectives were to: (i) identify traffic conditions under which TIs becomes hot-spots of PNCs, (ii) assess the effect of ventilation settings in free-flow and delay conditions (waiting time at a TI when traffic signal is red) on in-cabin PNCs with respect to on-road PNCs at TIs, (iii) deriving the relationship between the PNCs and change in driving speed during delay time at the TIs, and (iv) quantify the contribution of exposure at TIs with respect to overall commuting exposure. Congested TIs were found to become hot-spots when vehicle accelerate from idling conditions. In-cabin peak PNCs followed similar temporal trend as for on-road peak PNCs. Reduction in in-cabin PNC with respect to outside PNC was highest (70%) during free-flow traffic conditions when both fan drawing outdoor air into the cabin and heating was switched off. Such a reduction in in-cabin PNCs at TIs was highest (88%) with respect to outside PNC during delay conditions when fan was drawing outside air at 25% on and heating was 50% on settings. PNCs and change in driving speed showed an exponential-fit relationship during the delay events at TIs. Short-term exposure for similar to 2% of total commuting time in car corresponded to similar to 25% of total respiratory doses. This study highlights a need for more studies covering diverse traffic and geographical conditions in urban environments so that the disparate contribution of exposure at TIs can be quantified.

However, research has shown that choosing the appropriate denominator is non-trivial. Different crime types exhibit different spatial opportunities and so does the population at risk. The residential population is the most commonly used population at risk, but is unlikely to be suitable for crimes that involve mobile populations. In this article, we use ""crowd-sourced"" data in Leeds, England, to measure the population at risk, considering violent crime. These new data sources have the potential to represent mobile populations at higher spatial and temporal resolutions than other available data. Through the use of two local spatial statistics (Getis-Ord GI* and the Geographical Analysis Machine) and visualization, we show that when the volume of social media messages, as opposed to the residential population, is used as a proxy for the population at risk, criminal event hot spots shift spatially. Specifically, the results indicate a significant shift in the city center, eliminating its hot spot. Consequently, if crime reduction/prevention efforts are based on resident population based crime rates, such efforts may not only be ineffective in reducing criminal event risk, but be a waste of public resources.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,TWITTER;ASSOCIATION;INFORMATION;STATISTICS;Crime,,

Urban areas located in arid and semiarid lands somehow represent heat increase when it is compared with the heat in the surrounding rural areas. Thus, cities located amid forested and temperate climate regions show moderate temperatures. The impervious surfaces let the rainfall leave the city lands faster than undeveloped areas. This effect reduces water's cooling effects on these lands. More significantly, if trees and other vegetations are rare in any region, it means less evapotranspiration-the process by which trees ""exhale"" water. Trees also contribute to the cooling of urban lands by their shade. Land cover and land use maps can easily be produced by processing of remote sensing satellites' images, like processing of Landsat's images. As a result of this process, urban regions can be distinguished from vegetation. Analyzed GIS data produced and supported by these images can be utilized to determine the impact of urban land on energy, water, and carbon balances at the Earth's surface. Here in this study, it is found that remote sensing technique with thermal images is a liable technique to asses where urban heat islands and hot spots are located in cities. As an application area, in Izmir, it was found that the whole city was in high level of surface temperature as it was over 28 A degrees C during the summer times. Beside this, the highest temperature values which go up to 47 A degrees C are obtained at industrial regions especially where the iron-steel factories and the related industrial activities are.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SURFACE-TEMPERATURE;CHINA;GIS;Hot Temperature,,

Studies considering such complex environmental settings in a global manner are rare. We propose to use statistical factor and cluster analyses to create a composite exposure index with a data-driven approach, in view to assess the environmental burden experienced by populations. We illustrate this approach in a large French metropolitan area. The study was carried out in the Great Lyon area (France, 12 M inhabitants) at the census Block Group (BG) scale. We used as environmental indicators ambient air NO2 annual concentrations, noise levels and proximity to green spaces, to industrial plants, to polluted sites and to road traffic. They were synthesized using Multiple Factor Analysis (MFA), a data-driven technique without a priori modeling, followed by a Hierarchical Clustering to create BG classes. The first components of the MFA explained, respectively, 30, 14, 11 and 9% of the total variance. Clustering in five classes group: (1) a particular type of large BGs without population; (2) BGs of green residential areas, with less negative exposures than average; (3) BGs of residential areas near midtown; (4) BGs close to industries; and (5) midtown urban BGs, with higher negative exposures than average and less green spaces. Other numbers of classes were tested in order to assess a variety of clustering. We present an approach using statistical factor and cluster analyses techniques, which seem overlooked to assess cumulative exposure in complex environmental settings. Although it cannot be applied directly for risk or health effect assessment, the resulting index can help to identify hot spots of cumulative exposure, to prioritize urban policies or to compare the environmental burden across study areas in an epidemiological framework.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,URBAN POLLUTANT DISPERSION;ENVIRONMENTAL DEPRIVATION;RISK-ASSESSMENT;HEALTH;INEQUALITIES;MORTALITY;MIXTURES;JUSTICE;SIRANE;INDEX;Statistics as Topic,,

Here, the concept of a ""hot spot"" is defined as a place with rising house prices and in-migration of households with higher than average education and income. Perceptions and performances in these particular housing markets are studied using interviews. Three locations are explored through interviews with ""footloose"" households. The aim is to explore factors that shape rural housing market hot spots, using narratives from footloose in-migrants. There is a need for greater understanding of the spread and maintenance of hot spots and rural housing markets in regional planning. Also, housing markets in the countryside are more scantily investigated than in urban areas. In an unbalanced housing market, with higher prices and limited supply in the urban areas, hot spots in rural areas are anomalies that do not follow traditional housing market theories. Results show that hot spots are locations with natural beauty to which households moved upon finding employment. Footloose in-migrants are thus discovered to indicate a hot spot development. The hot spot areas have the ""extra"" natural beauty, cheap housing in combination with a high status, as well as it is a location suitable for commuting.

We report on measurements of air pollutants conducted in a street canyon in Stockholm (Sweden) in spring 2006. Particle number size distributions (PNSD) were measured in the 25-606 nm range, along with total particle number, light-absorbing carbon mass concentration (M-LAC), PM10, NOx, CO, traffic rate (TR), vehicle speed and meteorological variables. We used PNSD as input to the positive matrix factorisation (PMF) analysis to identify and apportion the pollutant sources. All pollutants showed distinct diurnal patterns, with highest concentrations in weekday mornings (08:00-09:00). TR was always higher on weekdays, except for the early hours (00:00-06:00). The raise in the weekend early-hour TR was accompanied by the largest MLAC of the day, a higher NOx/CO ratio compared to weekdays and a modal shift of PNSD towards larger diameters (47-56 nm), indicates a change in the vehicle fleet share to being dominated by diesel-run taxis. The largest contribution to the submicron particles was observed for winds blowing along the canyon, transporting particles emitted by vehicles accelerating from the traffic lights at the intersection, uphill towards the measurement site, and from the nearby streets. Three PMF factors were identified: local emissions from a mixed fleet dominated by gasoline engines, local traffic emissions highly impacted by diesel vehicles, and urban background aerosol. On average, gasoline-fuelled vehicles largely contributed to NOx, and particle number concentrations (54-65%), whereas M-LAC sources were dominated by diesel emissions, especially at weekends in the early hours (73%). The urban background contribution was rather low (4-13%) and with little dependence on the weekday. This work demonstrated how particle size distribution measurements, together with M-LAC, NOx and CO can be used to quantify the contribution from diesel and gasoline vehicles.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,EMISSION FACTORS;ON-ROAD;LABORATORY EVALUATION;ULTRAFINE PARTICLES;COMBUSTION AEROSOLS;DIESEL EXHAUST;AIR-QUALITY;URBAN;NANOPARTICLES;NOX,,

Recently software defined network (SDN) concept has become popular in many networking areas including mobile networks. One of the key promises is to provide an efficient way for network operators to extend and create new services. As the whole network is controlled by a single central entity that is based on software code, it would be easy to make large scale network upgrades without need to wait that updates are available for all network elements (NEs). There is, however, a clear conflict between SDN ideas and WMN operation. The performance and reliability of the latter one is heavily depended on fast local reactions to, e.g., link degradations. Centralized control would introduce longer delays in reactions.

The proposed methodology analyses the density of infrastructures in relation to their cross-sectoral and accumulative relevance using geospatial data samples from Germany.

Recently, the authors proposed an efficient method to identify secondary crashes on statewide freeway networks with reasonable accuracy. A 1-year case study was conducted for preliminary analysis. As a continuing effort, this research included four more years of secondary crash data and found that (a) rear-end and sideswipe crashes in the same direction were the top two secondary crash types; (b) road debris, construction zones, and obscured visibility were three major potential highway contributing factors; (c) following too closely, inattentive driving, losing vehicle control, and speeding were four major potential driver contributing factors; (d) temporal distributions by hour and month were different between secondary crashes and general crashes; and (e) secondary crash hot spots clustered around urban areas and were within 1 mi from major freeway interchanges. In addition, an algorithm was proposed to detect secondary crashes on the basis of police narratives in the crash reports. This algorithm was evaluated by using 5-year secondary crash data (4 years for training and 1 year for testing). By choosing an optimal threshold, this algorithm identified all true secondary crashes while keeping false positives at a low number.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,"",,

Reignition events occur under unstable combustion conditions and frequently result in particle number (PN) emission rates (PNERs) that exceed those for stabilized engine operation. Tailpipe PNERs from a CV and an HEV 2010 Toyota Camry were quantified on a 32-mi route over rural, urban, and freeway roadways in Chittenden County, Vermont, with the total onboard tailpipe emissions measurement system. This study directly compared the CV and HEV PNERs and characterized the operation of the HEY in a new HEV ICE operating mode framework. Mean PNER for reignition events (7.19 +/- 11.8 x 10(10) particles/s) were on average four times greater than for stabilized HEV operation (1.79 +/- 3.99 x 10(10) particles/s). Under urban, rural, and freeway driving, HEY reignition event operation accounted for 58.7%, 44.6%, and 5.0%, respectively, of the total PN inventory. Mean HEY PNER was 1.8 times greater than that of the CV in urban driving, while under freeway driving, where the two vehicles operated similarly, average CV PNER was 2.4 times greater than that of the HEY. The data show that the typical fuel consumption benefits of HEVs in urban driving are associated with a trade-off in PN emissions. The HEV ICE operating behavior has implications for the spatial distribution of PN hot spots as well as the associated microscale modeling of alternative vehicle technology emissions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,AIR-POLLUTION;ENGINE;TEMPERATURE;FUEL,,

It is facing severe air quality problems as a result of rapid urbanization and land use change, socioeconomic transformation, and high population growth. In this paper, we present the first full year (February 2013-January 2014) analysis of simultaneous measurements of two shortlived climate forcers/pollutants (SLCF/P), i.e., ozone (O-3) and equivalent black carbon (hereinafter noted as BC) and aerosol number concentration at Paknajol, in the city center of Kathmandu. The diurnal behavior of equivalent BC and aerosol number concentration indicated that local pollution sources represent the major contributions to air pollution in this city. In addition to photochemistry, the planetary boundary layer (PBL) and wind play important roles in determining O-3 variability, as suggested by the analysis of seasonal changes of the diurnal cycles and the correlation with meteorological parameters and aerosol properties. Especially during pre-monsoon, high values of O-3 were found during the afternoon/evening. This could be related to mixing and entrainment processes between upper residual layers and the PBL. The high O-3 concentrations, in particular during pre-monsoon, appeared well related to the impact of major open vegetation fires occurring at the regional scale. On a synoptic-scale perspective, westerly and regional atmospheric circulations appeared to be especially conducive for the occurrence of the high BC and O-3 values. The very high values of SLCF/P, detected during the whole measurement period, indicated persisting adverse air quality conditions, dangerous for the health of over 3 million residents of the Kathmandu Valley, and the environment. Consequently, all of this information may be useful for implementing control measures to mitigate the occurrence of acute pollution levels in the Kathmandu Valley and surrounding area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,5079 M A.S.L.;SOUTHERN HIMALAYAS;NCO-P;PM2.5;PM10;VARIABILITY;AEROSOLS;EVENTS;EUROPE;CLOUDS;Ozone;Seasons;Nepal;African Continental Ancestry Group,,

A number of methods are used to identify and calculate hot spots, such as dot maps, surface interpolation (kernel density estimation), and statistically identified cluster analysis. Relating to the latter set of methods, local Moran's I is one of the more commonly used methods for identifying local crime clusters. One important aspect for this method for subsequent analysis is that it uses areas, such as census boundary units, to identify local clusters of crime. Consequently, census data may be used to predict and better understand these local crime clusters. In this article, I use multinomial logistic regression and census variables to predict the local crime clusters identified by local Moran's I. This analysis shows a number of nuances regarding local crime clusters, and the spatial patterns of crime, more generally, can be identified using this two-stage approach.

The persistence of plastic in soil and aquatic environment has become ecological threat to the metropolitan city such as Bangalore, India. Present study investigates an ecofriendly, efficient and cost-effective approach for plastic waste management by the screening of novel microbial consortia which are capable of degrading plastic polymers. Plastic-contaminated soil and water samples were collected from six hot spots of urban and rural areas of Bangalore. The plastic-degrading bacteria were enriched, and degradation ability was determined by zone of clearance method. The percentage of polymer degradation was initially monitored by weight loss method, and the main isolates were characterized by standard microbiology protocols. These isolates were used to form microbial consortia, and the degradation efficiency of the consortia was compared with individual isolate and known strains obtained from the Microbial Type Culture Collection (MTCC) and Gene Bank, India. One of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation was identified, and the biodegradation mechanism was hypothesized by bioinformatics studies. From this study, it is evident that the bacteria utilized the plastic polymer as a sole source of carbon and showed 20-50 % weight reduction over a period of 120 days. The two main bacteria responsible for the degradation were microbiologically characterized to be Pseudomonas spp. These bacteria could grow optimally at 37 degrees C in pH 9.0 and showed 35-40 % of plastic weight reduction over 120 days. These isolates were showed better degradation ability than known strains from MTCC. The current study further revealed that the microbial consortia formulated by combining Psuedomonas spp. showed 40 % plastic weight reduction over a period of 90 days. Further, extracellular lipase, one of the main enzymes responsible for polymer degradation, was identified. The computational docking studies suggested that polyethylene glycol and polystyrene present in the plastics might have good interaction towards the microbial lipase with stable binding and interacting forces which probably could be one of the reasons for the degradative mechanisms.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,BACTERIAL CONSORTIUM;PSEUDOMONAS-AERUGINOSA;BIODEGRADATION;LIPASE;CULTURE;SOIL;IDENTIFICATION;POLYURETHANE;PURIFICATION;CONFORMATION;India;Mass Screening,,

Neutrophils migrate first to the infection site and accumulate quickly to high numbers. They fight pathogens by phagocytosis and intracellular toxication. Additionally, neutrophils form neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) to inhibit extracellular microbes. Yet, neutrophil trace element characteristics are largely unexplored. We investigated unstimulated and phorbol myristate acetate-stimulated neutrophils using synchrotron radiation X-ray fluorescence (SR-XRF) on the sub-micron spatial resolution level. PMA activates pinocytosis, cytoskeletal rearrangements and the release of NETs, all mechanisms deployed by neutrophils to combat infection. By analyzing Zn, Fe, Cu, Mn, P, S, and Ca, not only the nucleus but also vesicular granules were identifiable in the elemental maps. Inductively Coupled Plasma Mass Spectrometry (ICP-MS) revealed a neutrophil-specific composition of Zn, Fe, Cu, and Mn in comparison with J774 and HeLa cells, indicating a neutrophil-specific metallome complying with their designated functions. When investigating PMA-activated neutrophils, the SR-XRF analysis depicted typical subcellular morphological changes: the transformation of nucleus and granules and the emergence of void vacuoles. Mature NETs were evenly composed of Fe, P, S, and Ca with occasional hot spots containing Zn, Fe, and Ca. An ICP-MS-based quantification of NET supernatants revealed a NETosis-induced decrease of soluble Zn, whereas Fe, Cu, and Mn concentrations were only slightly affected. In summary, we present a combination of SR-XRF and ICP-MS as a powerful tool to analyze trace elements in human neutrophils.

Our results suggest that small drains have a disproportionate impact on enclosed beach water quality for five reasons: (1) dry weather surface flows (primarily from overirrigation of lawns and ornamental plants) harbor FIB at concentrations exceeding recreational water quality criteria; (2) small drains can trap dry weather runoff during high tide, and then release it in a bolus during the falling tide when drainpipe outlets are exposed; (3) nearshore turbulence is low (turbulent diffusivities approximately 10(-3) m(2) s(-1)), limiting dilution of FIB and other runoff-associated pollutants once they enter the bay; (4) once in the bay, runoff can form buoyant plumes that further limit vertical mixing and dilution; and (5) local winds can force buoyant runoff plumes back against the shoreline, where water depth is minimal and human contact likely. Outdoor water conservation and urban retrofits that minimize the volume of dry and wet weather runoff entering the local storm drain system may be the best option for improving beach water quality in Newport Bay and other urban-impacted enclosed beaches.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,FECAL INDICATOR BACTERIA;SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA;SURF ZONE;CONTROLLING        VARIABILITY;RECREATIONAL WATER;COASTAL WATER;NEWPORT BAY;POLLUTION;DISPERSION;ENTRAINMENT,,

While many municipalities in the province have no or relatively few dental offices, municipalities that are comparatively rich in both general and specialized dentists are rare and tend to be part of larger urban environments (typically census metropolitan areas), characterized by higher growth rates, higher median incomes, and lower median ages. Dentist office hot-spots within metropolitan areas occur in or near the downtown and in more peripheral/suburban locales. High sales dentist offices in suburban hot-spots appear to benefit from prosperous locations and supply deficits nearby, whereas inner-city dentist districts may form in part because of localization economies.

Six factors associated with potential sources were quantified, namely, secondary sulfate, ammonium nitrate and combustions, fossil fuels, traffic, industrial and glassmaking. Source apportionment results were further processed using a series of chemometric tools for returning additional information about the seasonal and spatial changes of factors extracted by the PMF analysis. In addition, PMF results were also studied in combination with weather conditions and PAH concentrations revealing that sources of secondary nitrate and sulfate are homogeneously distributed throughout the area, while remaining pollutant sources may have a distinct origin.

It is poorly understood, however, how the unique soil characteristics of brownfield wetlands contribute to or hinder denitrification. In this study, we examined drivers of ""hot'' denitrification rates over time (""hot moments'') and space (""hotspots'') in a watershed located on an unrestored brownfield in New Jersey, USA. We carried out measurements of denitrification over 9-day sequences during three seasons in sites with the same vegetation (Phragmites australis) but different soils (fill material, remnant marsh soils, flooded organic-rich soils). Denitrification rates above the 3rd quartile value of the data distribution were defined as ""hot'' and the most important drivers of these rates were determined using mixed models. Porosity and NO3- availability were the strongest spatial and temporal predictors, respectively, of high denitrification rates, with coarse-textured, unflooded fill materials unexpectedly supporting the highest rates. These results suggest that pore-scale hydrology is a more complex controller of wetland denitrification than previously thought. Course-textured, unflooded soils have high fractions of air-filled pores relative to flooded soils, leading to more endogenous NO3- production, and less diffusion constraints than fine-textured soils, leading to higher NO3- availability to denitrifiers in suboxic pores. Laboratory studies confirmed denitrifiers were limited by NO3- availability. However, denitrification rates in all soils matched or exceeded atmospheric NO3- deposition and stormwater NO3- loading at the site, suggesting that brownfields may play an important role in NO3- removal from urban stormwater.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,TEMPERATE FOREST SOILS;HYDRAULIC CONDUCTIVITY;PHRAGMITES-AUSTRALIS;RIPARIAN WETLANDS;WATER RETENTION;NITROGEN-CYCLE;MANAGEMENT;SPOTS;DYNAMICS;CONSEQUENCES,,

The prevalence of health risk behavior (HRB) in Czech youth such as smoking, drug and alcohol use is the highest in Europe.        Aim: To analyze differences in HRB in youth residents within different types of Prague's neighborhoods in relation to the perception of the built environment, quality of their school and home environments.        Data and methods: The data is based on the on-line survey among elementary school students aged between 14-15 years, which was administered in19 selected schools in Prague, during the months of October 2013 to March 2014. Respondents were asked their opinions on various issues related to their HRB, about their indoor and outdoor housing and school environments. The questionnaire was completed by 407 students. Factor analysis with a principal components extraction was applied to determine the underlying structure in the variables. A consequent field research was conducted to map the opportunity hot spots and critical places around the elementary schools.        Results: Binge drinking has been reported mainly by the students living in the housing estates with blocks of flats. The most frequent occurrence of daily smokers was found in the neighborhoods of old city apartment houses. High prevalence of risky marijuana use almost in all the surveyed types of neighborhoods. The respondents were more critical in their evaluation of school characteristics. The neighborhoods critically evaluated by the students as regards the school outdoor environments were the older apartment houses in the historical centre and inner city, the school indoor environment was worst assessed within the housing estate neighborhoods.        Conclusions: Our results suggest that perceptions of problems in both residential and school environment are associated with HRB. This fact makes this issue of a serious importance also from the policy point of view. Mainly the school surroundings have to be better managed by the local authorities responsible for the public space. This research thus forms part of the Sophie project aiming to find the most efficient policies that would tackle with the inequalities in the health and quality of life.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,BUILT ENVIRONMENT;DRUG-USE;ALCOHOL;DISORDER;ACCESS;DRINKING;CRIME;DISORGANIZATION;DISADVANTAGE;INEQUALITIES;Pilot Projects;Risk-Taking;Adolescent,,

Such techniques are capable not only of examining the epidemiological relationship between the environment and a disease, but can also focus limited resources and strategically inform where on the landscape outreach efforts may be optimized.        Methods: These analyses present several spatial statistical techniques among the HealthStreet population, a community-engaged organization with aims to link underrepresented populations to medical and social care as well as opportunities to participate in University-sponsored research. Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA) and Getis-Ord Gi*(d) statistics are utilized to examine where cancer-related ""hot spots"" exist among minority and non-minority HealthStreet respondents within Alachua County, Florida, United States (US). Interest in research is also reported, by minority status and lifetime history of cancer.        Results: Overall, spatial clustering of cancer was observed to vary by minority status, suggesting disparities may exist among minorities and non-minorities in regards to where cancer is occurring. Specifically, significant hot spots of cancer were observed among non-minorities in more urban areas throughout Alachua County, Florida, US while more rural clusters were observed among minority members, specifically west and southwest of urban city limits.        Conclusions: These results may help focus future outreach efforts to include underrepresented populations in health research, as well as focus preventative and palliative oncological care. Further, global community engaged studies and community outreach efforts outside of the United States may use similar methods to focus limited resources and recruit underrepresented populations into health research.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,AUTOCORRELATION,,

We investigated whether stormwater control measures (SCMs), a form of green infrastructure, integrated into restored and degraded urban stream networks can influence watershed nitrogen loads. We hypothesized that hydrologically connected floodplains and SCMs are ""hot spots"" for nitrogen removal through denitrification because they have ample organic carbon, low dissolved oxygen levels, and extended hydrologic residence times. We tested this hypothesis by comparing nitrogen retention metrics in two urban stream networks (one restored and one urban degraded) that each contain SCMs, and a forested reference watershed at the Baltimore Long-Term Ecological Research site. We used an urban watershed continuum approach which included sampling over both space and time with a combination of: (1) longitudinal reach-scale mass balances of nitrogen and carbon conducted over 2 years during baseflow and storms (n = 24 sampling dates x 15 stream reaches = 360) and (2) N-15 push-pull tracer experiments to measure in situ denitrification in SCMs and floodplain features (n = 72). The SCMs consisted of inline wetlands installed below a storm drain outfall at one urban site (restored Spring Branch) and a wetland/wet pond configured in an oxbow design to receive water during high flow events at another highly urbanized site (Gwynns Run). The SCMs significantly decreased total dissolved nitrogen (TDN) concentrations at both sites and significantly increased dissolved organic carbon concentrations at one site. At Spring Branch, TDN retention estimated by mass balance (g/day) was similar to 150 times higher within the stream network than the SCMs. There were no significant differences between mean in situ denitrification rates between SCMs and hydrologically connected floodplains. Longitudinal N budgets along the stream network showed that hydrologically connected floodplains were important sites for watershed nitrogen retention due to groundwater-surface water interactions. Overall, our results indicate that hydrologic variability can influence nitrogen source/sink dynamics along engineered stream networks. Our analysis also suggests that some major predictors for watershed N retention were: (1) streamwater and groundwater flux through stream restoration or stormwater management controls, (2) hydrologic residence times, and (3) surface area of hydrologically connected features.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,URBAN LANDSCAPE;LAND-USE;ECOSYSTEM RESTORATION;RIPARIAN ZONES;DEGRADED URBAN;ORGANIC-CARBON;CHESAPEAKE BAY;DENITRIFICATION;GROUNDWATER;NUTRIENT;Nitrogen,,

In this study, 230 surface soil samples (0-20 cm) were collected from agricultural areas of Jiaxing, a rapidly industrializing area in the Yangtze Delta of China. Sequential Gaussian simulation (SGS) and multivariate factorial kriging analysis (FKA) were used to identify and explore the sources of heavy metal pollution for eight metals (Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni, Cd, Hg and As). Localized hot-spots of pollution were identified for Cu, Zn, Pb, Cr, Ni and Cd with area percentages of 0.48 percent, 0.58 percent, 2.84 percent, 2.41 percent, 0.74 percent, and 0.68 percent, respectively. The areas with Hg pollution covered approximately 38 percent whereas no potential pollution risk was found for As. The soil parent material and point sources of pollution had significant influences on Cr, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd levels, except for the influence of agricultural management practices also accounted for micro-scale variations (nugget effect) for Cu and Zn pollution. Short-range (4 km) diffusion processes had a significant influence on Cu levels, although they did not appear to be the dominant sources of Zn and Cd variation. The short-range diffusion pollution arising from current and historic industrial emissions and urbanization, and long-range (33 km) variations in soil parent materials and/or diffusion jointly determined the current concentrations of soil Pb. The sources of Hg pollution risk may be attributed to the atmosphere deposition of industrial emission and historical use of Hg-containing pesticides. (C) 2014 Elsevier Inc.

In this regard, geo-location and user equipment positioning techniques help obtain spatial distributions of user locations and their respective traffic volumes. In this paper, we provide a tool capable of reducing errors that stem from spatial discretization of traffic data and that can autonomously detect hot spots given a certain threshold. Based on geo-located traffic in a 3G network in a dense urban city, we find that traffic in the area is approximately log-normally distributed and that the size of traffic hot spots are approximately Weibull distributed. Based on our statistical findings, we observe that utilizing 4 small cells per km(2) covering 3.2% of the total area and around 34% of the total traffic volume is a very meaningful deployment strategy; however, deploying more small cells in larger hot zones becomes increasingly costly in terms of the ratio of area covered and traffic demand serviced.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded"", ""taniabatistela""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: RedesWEB | USER-NOTES: {""Fagner ""=>[""3G network in a dense urban city - TRABALHA COM REDES DE COMPUTADOR""]}",,"",,

Fuel treatments are an important management tool in the drier forests of this region where they have been shown to modify fire behavior and fire effects, yet we know relatively little about how treatments will interact with changing climate and expanding human populations to influence fire regimes and ecosystem services over larger area and longer time periods. As a step toward addressing this knowledge gap, this paper synthesizes the recent literature on climate, fire, and forest management in the Pacific Northwest to summarize projected changes and assess how forest management can aid in adapting to future fire regimes and reducing their negative impacts. Increased wildfire under future climates has the potential to affect many ecosystem services, including wildlife habitat, carbon sequestration, and water and air quality. Fuel treatments in dry forest types can reduce fire severity and size, and strategically-placed treatments can help to protect both property and natural resources from wildfire. Although increased rates of burning are projected to reduce carbon stocks across the region, research to date suggests that fuel treatments are unlikely to result in significant increases in carbon storage. Prescribed burning combined with thinning has been demonstrated to be effective at reducing fire severity across a variety of dry forest types, but there is uncertainty about whether changing climate and increasing human encroachment into the wildland-urban interface will limit the use of prescribed fire in the future. Most fire research has focused on the dry forest types, and much less is known about the ecological impacts of increased wildfire activity in the moist forests and the potential for adapting to these changes through forest management. To address these knowledge gaps, future research efforts should build on the Pacific Northwest's legacy of integrated regional assessments to incorporate broad-scale climatic drivers with processes operating at the stand and landscape levels, including vegetation succession, fire spread, treatment effects, and the expansion of human populations into wildland areas. An important outcome of this type of research would be the identification of localized ""hot spots"" that are most sensitive to future changes, and are where limited resources for fire management should be concentrated.

The column CO showed relatively high values over southern-BoB whereas the near-surface CO showed low mixing ratio indicating the existence of significant amount of CO at higher altitudes. The vertical profiles of CO over the BoB region retrieved from MOPITT exhibit a high altitude peak around 9 km altitude region. The role of water vapour and convective activity/vertical updrafts in establishing the observed vertical profile of CO was investigated. It is found that CO got uplifted to the higher altitude due to updrafts and water vapour caused depletion of CO at lower altitudes which appeared as an apparent high in CO mixing ratio at higher altitude relative to that over lower altitude. The role of water vapour in the destruction of CO was confirmed by box model simulations. Airmass back-trajectory analysis showed that the long range transport from lower troposphere/boundary layer was also partially responsible for higher mixing ratios at higher altitude. In addition, a comparison of in-situ measured near-surface CO and those retrieved from MOPITT using retrieval algorithm Versions 4 and 5 showed that the points of discrepancy have reduced in the Version 5. Biomass burning and anthropogenic activities taking place over the Myanmar landmass was found to be responsible for the hot spots of near-surface-CO over the northeast-BoB. (C) 2014 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite an increased realization of the negative impacts of air pollution, assessing individuals' exposure to traffic-related air pollution remains a challenge. Obtaining high-resolution estimates are difficult due to the spatial and temporal variability of emissions, the dependence on local atmospheric conditions, and the lack of monitoring infrastructure. This presents a significant hurdle to identifying pollution concentration hot spots and understanding the emission sources responsible for these hot spots, which in turn makes it difficult to reduce the uncertainty of health risk estimates for communities and to develop policies that mitigate these risks. We present a novel air pollution estimation method that models the highway traffic state, highway traffic-induced air pollution emissions, and pollution dispersion, and describe a prototype implementation for the San Francisco Bay Area. Our model is based on the availability of real-time traffic estimates on highways, which we obtain using a traffic dynamics model and an estimation algorithm that augments real-time data from both fixed sensors and probe vehicles. These traffic estimates combined with local weather conditions are used as inputs to an emission model that estimates pollutant levels for multiple gases and particulates in real-time. Finally, a dispersion model is used to assess the spread of these pollutants away from the highway source. Maps generated using the output of the dispersion model allow users to easily analyze the evolution of individual pollutants over time, and provides transportation engineers and public health officials with valuable information that can be used to minimize health risks.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,AIR-POLLUTION;PARTICLES;QUALITY;SYSTEM;MODEL,,

This paper (1) develops an approach to quantify impervious surface change in urban areas using multi-temporal remotely-sensed data sets; and (2) links observed change to change in land use policies. Cixi County in Zhejiang Province, China was used as a representative case study. Landsat imagery from 1987, 1995, 2002, and 2009 was used to detect impervious surface change. First, impervious surfaces for each image were estimated at the sub-pixel level via multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis (MESMA). Second, a high pass change filter (HPCF) was proposed to identify impervious surface change over time. Third, the Getis-Ord (G(i)*) metric was applied to the HPCF results to determine areas of substantial change (hot spots). In terms of the first objective, results suggested that the HPCF-G(i)* metric could successfully reveal the location, intensity, and geographic extent of significant change in impervious surface coverage. With respect to the second objective, two major mechanisms of impervious surface change were identified: new land development and redevelopment of existing impervious surfaces. The nature and spatial pattern of these mechanisms can be explained through two classical urban growth models. We found that since 1994 the annual rate of impervious surface growth decreased considerably, suggesting that national land protection policies implemented in that year may have had some effect. However, the total area of impervious surface cover continued to increase, particularly in and around urban areas due to the above mechanisms. Both new land development and redevelopment could be linked to land use regulations and their implementation at the local level through local economic development pressure, the construction of transportation corridors, and the incentive structure for local government.

Over the last 25 years there has been increase epidemic activity of the disease in the Caribbean, with the co-circulation of multiple serotypes. An understanding of the space and time dynamics of dengue could provide health agencies with important clues for reducing its impact.        Methods: Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF) cases observed for the period 1998-2004 were georeferenced using Geographic Information System software. Spatial clustering was calculated for individual years and for the entire study period using the Nearest Neighbor Index. Space and time interaction between DHF cases was determined using the Knox Test while the Nearest Neighbor Hierarchical method was used to extract DHF hot spots. All space and time distances calculated were validated using the Pearson r significance test.        Results: Results shows that (1) a decrease in mean distance between DHF cases correlates with activity leading up to an outbreak, (2) a decrease in temporal distance between DHF cases leads to increased geographic spread of the disease, with an outbreak occurrence about every 2 years, and (3) a general pattern in the movement of dengue incidents from more rural to urban settings leading up to an outbreak with hotspot areas associated with transportation hubs in Trinidad.        Conclusion: Considering only the spatial dimension of the disease, results suggest that DHF cases become more concentrated leading up to an outbreak. However, with the additional consideration of time, results suggest that when an outbreak occurs incidents occur more rapidly in time leading to a parallel increase in the rate of distribution of the disease across space. The results of this study can be used by public health officers to help visualize and understand the spatial and temporal patterns of dengue, and to prepare warnings for the public. Dengue space-time patterns and hotspot detection will provide useful information to support public health officers in their efforts to control and predict dengue spread over critical hotspots allowing better allocation of resources.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,AEDES-AEGYPTI;POPULATION-DYNAMICS;WEST-INDIES;FEVER;OUTBREAK;TRANSMISSION;INFECTION;MOVEMENT;BEHAVIOR;RISK;Retrospective Studies;Travel,,

Landscape fragmentation has become a central issue in landscape ecology and conservation policies due to its direct influence on biodiversity which consequently endangers the sustainability of ecological goods and ecosystem services. Thus, fragmentation monitoring and assessment is a critical issue in land use planning and sustainable environmental management in order to avoid any irreversible negative consequences. This research explores the application of methodologies that employ multi-temporal satellite imagery, combined with geographical information systems and landscape metrics, to assess forest fragmentation. The objective is to determine spatio-temporally the LUCCs focusing on the woody vegetation in Hymettus Mountain of Greece over the last decades. The study area, which has been designated as a Natura 2000 site, is situated near the city of Athens. It faces various perturbations triggered by socio-economic factors and the absence of an ongoing contextual appraisal for conservation. To quantify the LUCCs, nine Landsat images spanning 28 years are classified. Post classification comparison is applied to generate transition maps. Additionally, eight landscape metrics are calculated. The change detection results identify hot-spots of forest fragmentation where mitigation measures should be taken, so that further irreversible alteration of the ecosystem is prevented. The landscape metrics advocate that, during the last three decades, the woody vegetation have steadily been more fragmented. The primary direct causes are economic driven intense anthropogenic activities along with frequent wildland fires whereas the indirect cause is the absence of a sustainable environmental management and conservation strategy.

The proposed technique overcomes one of the biggest technical challenges of Lamb wave crack detection for real structure applications: crack-induced Lamb waves are often mixed with multiple reflections from complex waveguides. In particular, crack detection in a welded joint, one of the structural hot spots due to stress concentration, is accompanied by reflections from the welded joint as well as a crack. Extracting and highlighting crack-induced Lamb wave modes from Lamb wave responses measured at multi-spatial points along a single line can be accomplished through a frequency-wavenumber domain analysis. The advantages of the proposed technique enable us not only to enhance the crack detectability in the welded joint but also to minimize false alarms caused by environmental and operational variations by avoiding the direct comparison with the baseline data previously accumulated from the pristine condition of a target structure. The proposed technique is experimentally and numerically validated in vertically stiffened metallic structures, revealing that it successfully identifies and localizes subsurface cracks, regardless of the coexistence with the vertical stiffener.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,DAMAGE DETECTION;NETWORK;PLATES;Welding,,

[Math. Models. Meth. Appl. Sci., 18, Suppl. (2008), pp. 1249-12671. Such patterns, characterized by the concentration of criminal activity in localized spatial regions, are referred to as hot-spot patterns and they occur in a parameter regime far from the Turing point associated with the bifurcation of spatially uniform solutions. Singular perturbation techniques are used to construct steady-state hot-spot patterns in one and two-dimensional spatial domains, and new types of nonlocal eigenvalue problems are derived that determine the stability of these hot-spot patterns to 0(1) time-scale instabilities. From an analysis of these nonlocal eigenvalue problems, a critical threshold Ice is determined such that a pattern consisting of K hot-spots is unstable to a competition instability if K > K-c This instability, due to a positive real eigenvalue, triggers the collapse of some of the hot-spots in the pattern. Furthermore, in contrast to the well-known stability results for spike patterns of the Gierer-Meinhardt reaction-diffusion model, it is shown for the crime model that there is only a relatively narrow parameter range where oscillatory instabilities in the hot-spot amplitudes occur. Such an instability, due to a Hopf bifurcation, is studied explicitly for a single hot-spot in the shadow system limit, for which the diffusivity of criminals is asymptotically large. Finally, the parameter regime where localized hot-spots occur is compared with the parameter regime, studied in previous works, where Turing instabilities from a spatially uniform steady-state occur.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,GRAY-SCOTT MODEL;ASYMMETRIC SPIKE PATTERNS;GIERER-MEINHARDT SYSTEM;OSCILLATORY INSTABILITIES;SELF-REPLICATION;MESA PATTERNS;DYNAMICS;EXISTENCE;EQUILIBRIA;BIFURCATIONS;Crime,,

As a methodology, the statistical time-space pattern analyses are used to identify the hot spots of crime occurrence in Seocho-gu of 2004 and 2006. Interestingly, the results show that crime hot spots are often observed in the transition areas between commercial land and residential area, and mixed land use areas with large floating population. This strongly reveals that physical environment may have an effect on crime occurrence and even prevent it through a proper urban planning, such as Crime Prevention through Environmental Design (CPTED). Accordingly, one may provide safe urban environment through providing buffer zones in front of crime-ridden areas, or continuing urban regeneration projects. Various urban planning elements and factors should be discussed and applied to urban planning hierarchy after considering socio-cultural aspects. The results of this study are expected to be utilized to the regional characteristics and urban planning factors so that fear of crime decrease and then to promote safe city construction afterwards which is being propelled nationally.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,Crime,,

This paper proposes a method to detect the dynamics of space-time development of urban activity patterns that are embedded in large volume trajectory data. Taxi cabs' trajectory data in the city of San Francisco were analyzed to identify activity instances, activity hot spots, and space-time dynamics of activity hot spots. The urban activity hot spots, evolving through different stages and across the city, provide a comprehensive depiction of the space-time activity patterns in the urban landscape. The dynamic patterns of the activity hot spots can be used to retrieve historical events and to predict future activity hot spots, which may be valuable for transportation and public safety management.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,SIMILARITY;LOCATIONS;MOVEMENT,,

Previous investigations of this phenomenon have found that, most often, crime displacement is nonexistent or less than crime reductions in the primary area of interest. In this article, we investigate local crime displacement. We use a spatial point pattern test that can identify changes in the spatial patterns/distribution of crime even if crime in all areas has decreased.

An example of this disconnect occurs in studies of wildlife-vehicle collisions (WVCs). Subjective procedures are often used to delineate hotspots of WVCs, resulting in hotspots that are not spatially independent. We developed a new approach that identifies independent hotspots using attributes of the landscape to inform delineations instead of subjective measures. First, we generated a candidate set of grouping scenarios using unique combinations of kernel-density estimation parameterization (i.e., bandwidth and isopleth values). Next, we associated the groups of WVCs with attributes of the surrounding landscape. Finally, we identified the grouping scenario with the highest amount of variation in the landscape among the groups. The highest variation corresponded to hotspots that were most distinguishable from each other (i.e., most independent) based on the surrounding landscape. We tested our approach on 3 species of wildlife [island foxes (Urocyon littoralis) on San Clemente Island, CA; white-tailed deer (Odocoileus virginianus) in Onondaga County, NY; and moose (Alces alces) in western Maine] that exemplified varying degrees of space-use in different landscapes. We found that the landscape-based approach was able to effectively delineate independent hotspots for each species without using subjective measures. The landscape-based approach delineated fewer or larger hotspots than currently used methods, suggesting a reduction in spatial dependency among hotspots. Variation in the landscape indicated that hotspots may be larger than previously identified; therefore current mitigation strategies should be adjusted to include larger areas of high risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,HOME-RANGE;LAND-COVER;PSEUDOREPLICATION;LOCATIONS;ACCURACY;MOOSE;URBAN;SIZE;DEER,,

These areas are facing high risks of violating the national legislation threshold for NO2 (40 mu g(-3)). The SO2 background concentrations were generally below the legislation threshold (50 mu g(-3)). Motorbikes, which dominate the Hanoi vehicle fleet, are the main polluters of NO2 and benzene, whereas SO2 comes mainly from diesel buses and trucks, except in some areas that are directly affected by industrial coal burning. Stringently regulating the exhaust emissions of vehicles, especially for motorbikes, and reducing the sulfur and benzene contents in fuels could be implemented to improve Hanoi's air quality.

The higher efficiency (total bacterial inactivation after 10 min of irradiation) was observed in the absence of TiO2 when the wastewater was irradiated using the 250 W lamp. In the presence of TiO2 a decreasing inactivation trend was observed (99.76% and 72.22% inactivation after 10 min irradiation at 0.10 and 2.00 g TiO2 L-1 respectively). Under solar simulated conditions the highest inactivation efficiency (93.17%) after 10 min of irradiation was achieved at the lower photocatalyst loading (0.05 g TiO2 L-1). The concept of ""reactor optical thickness"" was introduced to explain the rates of disinfection observed. The optimum photocatalyst loading estimated by radiation absorption-scattering modeling was found to be 0.1 g TiO2 L-1 for all lamps. The difference between experimental tests and modeling may be due to TiO2 particles aggregation. Comparative kinetic tests between solar and solar simulated photocatalytic (SSP) processes using 0.05 g TiO2 L-1 in suspension showed a quite similar inactivation behavior up to 30 mm of irradiation, but only the SSP process resulted in a total inactivation of bacteria after 60 min of exposure.

Few studies have examined the spatial distribution of overweight and obesity at the community level, an area of geography recommended for prevention and intervention. Therefore, the present study aimed to examine the spatial variation of overweight and obesity using community geographic boundaries.        MethodsA cross-sectional secondary spatial data analysis was conducted using three combined cycles of Canadian Community Health Survey data for the province of Nova Scotia with community level boundaries. Descriptive rates were calculated using standardised incidence ratio values and spatial analysis was carried out using Global and Local Moran's I and the GetisOrdGi* statistic for cluster identification.        ResultsMaps illustrating local cluster analysis showed a significant degree of similarity between neighbouring communities in urban areas more so than rural communities. Hot spot analysis maps showed communities clustering together in the urban centre tended to have lower incidence of overweight and obesity (cool spots'), whereas clustered communities in a more rural area had a higher incidence of overweight and obesity (hot spots).        ConclusionsThe present study showed that there was geographical variation in overweight and obesity between urban and rural communities, and also there was a tendency for communities to cluster based on the incidence of overweight and obesity. This highlights the importance of understanding community level obesity rates and associated behavioural determinants, such as diet and physical activity, as well as the role that urbanisation or rurality may play in intervention initiatives for these behavioural determinants. Specifically, public health nutrition efforts for community level food environments in rural areas should ensure an individualised approach is used, whereas urban areas may be amenable to more general approaches aiming to support healthy weight status among the broader population.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,ENVIRONMENTAL DETERMINANTS;FOOD ENVIRONMENTS;PHYSICAL-ACTIVITY;NEIGHBORHOOD;ASSOCIATION;FRAMEWORK;EPIDEMIC;STATE;RISK,,

An example is increasing multi-AR due to mobile carbapenemases, such as NDM-1 protein (coded by bla(NDM-1) genes), which can produce extreme drug-resistant phenotypes. In 2010, NDM-1 positive isolates and bla(NDM-1) genes were detected in surface waters across Delhi and have since been detected across the urban world. However, little is known about bla(NDM-1), levels in more pristine locations, such as the headwaters of the Upper Ganges River. This area is of particular interest because it receives massive numbers of visitors during seasonal pilgrimages in May/June, including visitors from urban India. Here we quantified bla(NDM-1) abundances, other AR genes (ARG), and coliform bacteria in sediments and water column samples from seven sites in the Rishikesh-Haridwar region of the Upper Ganges and five sites on the Yamuna River in Delhi to contrast bla(NDM-1) levels and water quality conditions between season and region. Water quality in the Yamuna was very poor (e.g., anoxia at all sites), and bla(NDM-1)., abundances were high across sites in water (5.4 +/- 0.4 log(bla(NDM-1).mL(-1)); 95% confidence interval) and sediment (6.3 +/- 0.7 log(bla(NDM-1).mg(-1))) samples from both seasons. In contrast, water column bla(NDM-1) abundances were very low across all sites in the Upper Ganges in February (2.1 +/- 0.6 log(bla(NDM-1).mL(-1)), and water quality was good (e.g., near saturation oxygen). However, per capita bla(NDM-1) levels were 20 times greater in June in the Ganges water column relative to February, and bla(NDM-1)., levels significantly correlated with fecal coliform levels (r = 0.61; p = 0.007). Given that waste management infrastructure is limited in Rishikesh-Haridwar, data imply bla(NDM-1) levels are higher in visitor's wastes than local residents, which results in seasonally higher bla(NDM-1) levels in the river. Pilgrimage areas without adequate waste treatment are possible ""hot spots"" for AR transmission, and waste treatment must be improved to reduce broader AR dissemination via exposed returning visitors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ANTIBIOTIC-RESISTANCE;BETA-LACTAMASES;HEALTH;NDM-1;BACTERIA;LAGOONS;UK;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Seasons,,

We undertook a national geographical mapping exercise in 2011/2012 to assess the locations and population size of FSW in Kenya, to facilitate targeted HIV prevention services for this population.        Methods and Findings: We used a geographical mapping approach, consisting of interviews with secondary key informants to identify ""hot"" spots frequented by FSW, their operational dynamics and the estimated numbers of FSW in those spots. This was followed by validation of the estimates through interviews with FSW at each spot identified. The mapping covered Nairobi, the capital city of Kenya, and 50 other major urban centres. In total, 11,609 secondary key informant interviews were conducted to identify FSW spots. Further, a total of 6,360 FSW were interviewed for spot validation purposes. A total of 10,670 spots where FSW congregate were identified. The estimated FSW population in all the towns mapped was 103,298 (range 77,878 to 128, 717). Size estimates in the towns mapped were extended to smaller towns that were not mapped, using a statistical model. The national urban FSW population estimate was 138,420 (range 107, 552 to 169, 288), covering all towns of over 5,000 population. We estimated that approximately 5% of the urban female population of reproductive age in Kenya could be sex workers, which is consistent with previous estimates from other sub-Saharan African countries.

The results revealed that the mean center of all kinds of crimes is in city center. The nearest neighbor index for drug crimes distribution had a full cluster distribution. The correlation coefficient confirmed the relationship between population density and committing the crimes. The results revealed that most of the crimes were committed in abandoned, residential, street networks and commercial land uses, while in religious and cultural land use less crime occurred. There were significant correlation between population density, different urban land uses and the rate of crime.

The identification of putative environmental determinants of urban rat infestations and the mapping of areas prone to experiencing such infestations (hot spots) are crucial for effectively addressing intervention efforts. We investigated the associations between a selection of environmental factors and the occurrence of rat infestations in the city of Madrid, Spain. This was done by modelling 10,956 citizen-reported rat sightings from 2002 to 2008 using generalized additive models, both at municipality (Madrid) and district (Latina) levels. Increased age and density of housing, and decreased distance to vegetated areas, markets and cat feeding stations were factors associated with an increased risk of rat infestations. Risk maps for rat infestations were also developed and recurrent hot spots of rat activity were identified. Although a better fit to the data was obtained in the model for the smaller scale and possibly more environmentally homogenous study area of Latina, modelling the spatial distribution of rat sightings was useful for identifying factors associated with an increased risk of urban rat infestations, as well as for identifying hot spots of rat activity, providing local authorities with a practical tool for effectively targeting intervention efforts to high-risk situations based on the local environmental contexts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,NORVEGICUS BERK.;RODENT CONTROL;CITY;Risk Factors;Rats;Urban Population,,

Two hot spots of higher frequency of summer heavy rainfall events are observed. One is located over the urban core region and the other resides in the climatological downwind region. Two comparative sets of model runs are designed to assess the effect of land surface properties with and without the presence of the city on the model simulation results. By comparing the two sets of model runs, the changes of rainfall statistics, behaviors of storm cells, and variables related to convection due to urbanization are analyzed and quantified. The intensity of heavy rainfall is increased over the urban and downwind region, corresponding to the locations of the two observed hot spots based on rain gauges. The changes of rainfall statistics suggest that the probability distribution of rainfall is shifted toward a heavier upper tail distribution. The Lagrangian properties of storm cells are examined using a newly developed Storm-Cell Identification procedure. High-echo storm cells tend to split approaching the city and merge in the downwind region. The level of free convection and the height of the planetary boundary layer are significantly increased over the urban region and maximum convective available potential energy is decreased. Increased sensible heat flux from the urban surfaces plays a dominant role in the modification of simulated rainfall from a climatological perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SIMULATED STORM STRUCTURE;ANTHROPOGENIC HEAT;PRECIPITATION EFFICIENCY;CONVECTIVE STORMS;URBAN AREAS;IMPACT;URBANIZATION;CLIMATE;THUNDERSTORMS;SENSITIVITY,,

Based on the variogram, area-to-point (ATP) Poisson kriging and p-field simulation were used to downscale and simulate, respectively, the OC rate data for Taiwan from the district scale to a 1 km x 1 km grid scale. Local cluster analysis (LCA) of OC mortality rates was then performed to identify OC mortality rate hot spots based on the downscaled and the p-field-simulated OC mortality maps. The relationship between OC mortality and land use was studied by overlapping the maps of the downscaled OC mortality, the LCA results, and the land uses. One thousand simulations were performed to quantify local and spatial uncertainties in the LCA to identify OC mortality hot spots. The scatter plots and Spearman's rank correlation yielded the relationship between OC mortality and concentrations of the seven metals in the 1 km cell grid. The correlation analysis results for the 1 km scale revealed a weak correlation between OC mortality rate and concentrations of the seven studied heavy metals in soil. Accordingly, the heavy metal concentrations in soil are not major determinants of OC mortality rates at the 1 km scale at which soils were sampled. The LCA statistical results for local indicator of spatial association (LISA) revealed that the sites with high probability of high-high (high value surrounded by high values) OC mortality at the 1 km grid scale were clustered in southern, eastern, and mid-western Taiwan. The number of such sites was also significantly higher on agricultural land and in urban regions than on land with other uses. The proposed approach can be used to downscale and evaluate uncertainty in mortality data from a coarse scale to a fine scale at which useful additional information can be obtained for assessing and managing land use and risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"GEOSTATISTICAL ANALYSIS;MULTIVARIATE-ANALYSIS;KRIGING METHODS;LUNG-CANCER;POLLUTION;TAIWAN;BIOACCESSIBILITY;PATTERNS;COUNTY;SYSTEM;Mouth Neoplasms;Metals, Heavy",,

What is the value of additional monitoring and where should future data-collection efforts focus on? In this study, we address two frequently asked questions in watershed modelling by implementing Bayesian inference techniques to parameterize SPAtially Referenced Regressions On Watershed attributes (SPARROW), a model that empirically estimates the relation between in-stream measurements of nutrient fluxes and the sources/sinks of nutrients within the watershed. Our case study is the Hamilton Harbour watershed, a mixed agricultural and urban residential area located at the western end of Lake Ontario, Canada. The proposed Bayesian approach explicitly accounts for the uncertainty associated with the existing knowledge from the system and the different types of spatial correlation typically underlying the parameter estimation of watershed models. Informative prior parameter distributions were formulated to overcome the problem of inadequate data quantity and quality, whereas the potential bias introduced from the pertinent assumptions is subsequently examined by quantifying the relative change of the posterior parameter patterns. Our modelling exercise offers the first estimates of export coefficients and delivery rates from the different subcatchments and thus generates testable hypotheses regarding the nutrient export hot spots' in the studied watershed. Despite substantial uncertainties characterizing our calibration dataset, ranging from 17% to nearly 400%, we arrived at an uncertainty level for the whole-basin nutrient export estimates of only 36%. Finally, we conduct modelling experiments that evaluate the potential improvement of the model parameter estimates and the decrease of the predictive uncertainty if the uncertainty associated with the current nutrient loading estimates is reduced.

Among the south Indian cities, Chennai is endemic for malaria. The present study aimed to identify the hot spots of malaria prevalence and the relationship with other factors in Chennai during 2005-2011.        Methods: Data on zone-wise and ward-wise monthly malaria positive cases were collected from the Vector Control Office, Chennai Corporation, for the year 2005 to 2011 and verified using field data. This data was used to calculate the prevalence among thousand people. Hotspot analysis for all the years in the study period was done to observe the spatial trend. Association of environmental factors like altitude, population density and climatic variables was assessed using ArcGIS 9.3 version and SPSS 11.5. Pearson's correlation of climate parameters at 95% and 99% was considered to be the most significant. Social parameters of the highly malaria prone region were evaluated through a structured random questionnaire field survey.        Results: Among the ten zones of Chennai Corporation, Basin Bridge zone showed high malaria prevalence during the study period. The 'hotspot' analysis of malaria prevalence showed the emergence of newer hotspots in the Adyar zone. These hotspots of high prevalence are places of moderately populated and moderately elevated areas. The prevalence of malaria in Chennai could be due to rainfall and temperature, as there is a significant correlation with monthly rainfall and one month lag of monthly mean temperature. Further it has been observed that the socioeconomic status of people in the malaria hotspot regions and unhygienic living conditions were likely to aggravate the malaria problem.        Conclusion: Malaria hotspots will be the best method to use for targeting malaria control activities. Proper awareness and periodical monitoring of malaria is one of the quintessential steps to control this infectious disease. It has been argued that identifying the key environmental conditions favourable for the occurrence and spread of malaria must be integrated and documented to aid future predictions of malaria in Chennai.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,RISK;TRANSMISSION;BANGLADESH;VARIABLES;CHILDREN;VECTOR;COUNTY;KENYA;Prevalence;Socioeconomic Factors;Malaria,,

A geographic information system was used to analyze hot spots. The analysis showed that parking problems were generally worse in or near downtown and became less prevalent toward the outer perimeter of the city. However, truck parking did not seem to be a serious issue in the part of the city that had been home to industrial sites for a long time. Regression analysis revealed that truck parking problems could be exacerbated by concentrations of food businesses in newly developed neighborhoods with a low density of vehicles owned by residents. This finding underscored the importance of land use plans and urban and streetscape designs that took into account trucks in neighborhoods that might not seem to generate intense truck activities.

By the use of information on the signal phases and the queue discharge time, ecodriving could optimize the speed trajectories for a vehicle approaching an intersection to reduce fuel consumption and emissions. This research developed an optimization model to determine the optimal ecodriving trajectory (the speed profile) at a signalized intersection. The model aimed to achieve the minimization of a linear combination of emissions and travel time. The Motor Vehicle Emissions Simulator was used to estimate the emissions (nitrogen oxide), and the genetic algorithm was selected to solve the optimization problem that was developed. A sensitivity analysis was conducted to analyze and compare the performance of the optimal solution in various scenarios. The results of the case study showed that ecodriving could achieve satisfactory reductions in emissions by more than 50% and in travel time by about 7% compared with the emissions and travel times obtained by use of a normal driving strategy.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

Improved traffic crash data systems, including the geographic information system (GIS), are helping to identify when, where, and why traffic crashes occur. Because the vast majority of motor vehicle traffic crashes are attributed to some type of driver error, the need for traffic law enforcement is evident. Traffic law enforcement holds the promise of being an effective part of regulating and modifying the behavior of drivers, and, therefore, it is part of an effective countermeasure strategy. GIS and other methods have been used to identify problem locations or hot spots, but networkwide crashes and enforcement have not traditionally been considered. If a general deterrent effect is derived from visible traffic law enforcement, then when and where the countermeasure is applied become prominent. This research used GIS to spatially relate nearly 10,000 crashes and more than 179,000 citations issued on approximately 800 mi of rural freeways in Florida. Traffic volume data were used to normalize the data set and were analyzed with descriptive statistics and enforcement-to-crashes ratios.

Typically vehicles on arterial roads frequently stop and then accelerate, a behavior that produces more tailpipe emissions than does maintaining a steady speed. Microscopic simulation models generate synthetic vehicle activity that can be used to estimate emissions on a facility. For emissions to be estimated accurately from an arterial facility, the simulated activity must closely represent the activity observed in the field. This study investigated whether a selected set of simulation parameters that used speed trajectories observed in the field at high temporal resolution could improve the emissions estimated from a simulated signalized arterial corridor. The simulated trajectories and those observed in the field were characterized by vehicle-specific power (VSP). Emissions were estimated with VSP modal emission rates and the time spent by vehicles in each VSP mode. The emissions were compared for routes along an urban arterial facility and for shorter segments within routes. At both spatial scales, the emissions from parameter-adjusted simulation vehicles that had the same average number of stops and travel time distribution as vehicles observed in the field were closer to real-world emissions than were the simulation vehicles under default model parameters. Adjusting the parameters also allowed the model to capture emissions hot spots along the routes more accurately. Currently, microscopic simulation models are calibrated with traffic performance measures that are improving. The findings from this paper present the potential for using these improving emissions estimates from simulated vehicle activity for the additional calibration of microsimulation models.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,VEHICLE FUEL CONSUMPTION;SPEED,,

Inappropriate speed and mental underload have been identified as important causal factors nearby such transitions. A variety of traffic calming measures (TCM) near rural urban transitions has been tested in field experiments and driving simulator studies. Simulator experiments repeatedly exposing participants to the same treatment are scarce, hence it is unclear to what extent the effects of a TCM endure over time.        This is precisely the objective of the current study: to examine what happens with the behavior of drivers when they are exposed multiple times to the same treatment (in this case a gate construction located at a rural urban transition). Over a period of five successive days, seventeen participants completed a 17 km test-drive on a driving simulator with two thoroughfare configurations (gates present or absent) in a within-subject design. Results indicate that gates induced a local speed reduction that sustained over this five-day period. Even though participants were inclined to accelerate again once passed by this gate configuration, they always kept driving at an appropriate speed. We did not find any negative side effects on SD of acceleration/deceleration or SDLP.        Overall we conclude that gate constructions have the potential to improve traffic safety in the direct vicinity of rural urban transitions, even if drivers are repeatedly exposed. Notwithstanding, we advise policy makers to appropriately use this measure. Best is to always carefully consider the broader situational context (such as whether the road serves a traffic- rather than a residential function) of each particular location where the implementation of a gate construction is one of the options.

The emergence of urban gardening movements in postindustrial cities necessitates accurate assessment of soil lead levels to ensure safe gardening. In this study, we examined small-scale spatial variability of soil lead within a 15 x 30m urban garden plot established on two adjacent residential lots located in Detroit, Michigan, USA. Eighty samples collected using a variably spaced sampling grid were analyzed for total, fine fraction (less than 250 m), and bioaccessible soil lead. Measured concentrations varied at sampling scales of 1-10m and a hot spot exceeding 400ppm total soil lead was identified in the northwest portion of the site. An interpolated map of total lead was treated as an exhaustive data set, and random sampling was simulated to generate Monte Carlo distributions and evaluate alternative sampling strategies intended to estimate the average soil lead concentration or detect hot spots. Increasing the number of individual samples decreases the probability of overlooking the hot spot (type II error). However, the practice of compositing and averaging samples decreased the probability of overestimating the mean concentration (type I error) at the expense of increasing the chance for type II error. The results reported here suggest a need to reconsider U.S. Environmental Protection Agency sampling objectives and consequent guidelines for reclaimed city lots where soil lead distributions are expected to be nonuniform.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,HOUSE-DUST;BIOAVAILABILITY;EXPOSURE,,

I built a general, integrative approach to focus on both land use and livelihood functions of crop landraces in the context of nontraditional, migration-related livelihoods amid global change. The research involved a multimethod, case-study design focused on a cultural landscape of maize, i.e., corn, growing in the Andes of central Bolivia, which is a global hot spot for this crop's agrobiodiversity. Central questions included the following: (1) What are major agroecological functions and food-related services of the agrobiodiversity of Andean maize landraces, and how are they related to cultural landscapes and associated knowledge systems? (2) What are new migration-related livelihood groups, and how are their dynamic livelihoods propelled through global change, in particular international and national migration, linked to the use and cultural landscapes of agrobiodiversity? (3) What are management and policy options derived from the previous questions? Combined social-ecological services as both cultivation and food resources are found to function in relation to the cultural landscape. Results demonstrated major variations of maturation-based, phenologic traits and food-use properties that are cornerstones of the landrace-level agrobiodiversity of Andean maize. Knowledge of these parameters is widespread. Linkage of these production and consumption functions yields a major insight into dynamics of Andean maize agrobiodiversity. Concurrently, this smallholder cultural landscape has become increasingly dependent on new rural conditions, especially increased livelihood diversification and migration amid growing peri-urban influences. Viability of landrace-level maize agrobiodiversity between 2006 and 2012 is shown to have occurred amid a transition toward the integral roles of multiple migration-related groups, namely women farmers, consumers, and local business owners; migrants; field caretakers; and local in-migrant laborers. The nontraditional social networks among these livelihood groups must be incorporated into analysis and planning of the design, participation, and monitoring of management and policy options for cultural landscapes ensuring the use, in situ conservation, and sustainability, including ecosystem services, of food plant landraces in global agrobiodiversity hot spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-CHANGE SCIENCE;POLITICAL ECOLOGY;AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPES;SMALLHOLDER AGRICULTURE;SUSTAINABILITY SCIENCE;ECOSYSTEM SERVICES;WESTERN HIGHLANDS;LATIN-AMERICA;CONSERVATION;MAIZE,,

We have mapped the concentrations of these elements and identified the major influences on their distributions.        Material and methods We sampled the topsoil at 125 sites across 1,050 km(2) of peri-urban land to the south east of the city on two grids, one nested inside the other. At each site, we measured the current contents of the four trace elements in the soil. We used robust geostatistical methods to model the complex spatial distributions of the data as mixtures of fixed and random effects. The empirical best linear unbiased predictor was used to map the elements. Site descriptors (lithology, land cover, cultivation, relief, erosion, and stoniness) were then included as covariates to identify significant effects on trace element concentrations.        Results and discussion The complex spatial distributions of the elements seem to arise from several sources. The concentrations generally increase from southeast to northwest, i.e., with increasing proximity to Madrid itself, the main potential source of pollution. This pattern is clear for lead and similar for copper and zinc, though with ""hot spots"" at or near industrial sites. The spatial pattern of cadmium is more complex and depends on varied lithology, industry, and land use such as irrigation and cultivation. In general, the concentrations of the four elements appear to decrease with increases in stoniness and erosion, and to be largest on the valley floors.        Conclusions Robust geostatistical methods enabled us to analyze and map the complex patterns of spatial variation of trace elements in a peri-urban region of Madrid. They show that distance to the city center, lithology, manufacturing industry, and cultivation all play their parts in loading the soil with lead, copper, zinc, and cadmium. In the event, none of the metals has yet exceeded the legislative thresholds, but some concentrations are already substantially greater than would arise from natural sources, especially closest to Madrid itself.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,HEAVY-METALS;URBAN SOILS;COPPER;CITY;CONTAMINATION;POLLUTION;TOPSOILS;CADMIUM;Trace Elements,,

According to Monaco theory clinical form of the disease depends on maintaining or disrupting the reading frame. The purpose of the study was to determine frequency and location of deletions and duplications in the dystrophin gene, to determine the compliance between maintaining/disrupting the reading frame and clinical form of the disease and to check the effectiveness of MLPA (multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification) in the detection of these mutations in hemizygous patients and heterozygous female carriers. The material is composed of combined results of molecular diagnosis carried out in years 20092012 in 180 unrelated patients referred with the diagnosis of DMD/BMD tested by use of MLPA. We identified 110 deletions, 22 duplication (in one patient two different duplications were detected) and 2 point mutations. Deletions involved mainly exons 45-54 and 3-21, whereas most duplications involved exons 3-18. The compliance with Monaco theory was 95% for deletions and 76% for duplications. Most of mutations in the dystrophin gene were localized in the hot spots - different for deletions and duplications. MLPA enabled their quick identification, exact localization and determination whether or not they maintained or disrupted the reading frame.

The results for the 2-year period (January 2009-December 2010) show a daily-mean BC variability from similar to 1.00 +/- 0.12 mu g m(-3) to 12.50 +/- 3.06 mu g m(-3), with a remarkable annual pattern of winter high and monsoon low. The BC values maximize during winter (December-January), similar to 6.67 +/- 0.22 mu g m(-3), and drop during summer (June-August), similar to 2.36 +/- 0.09 mu g m(-3), which establishes a large seasonal variation. Furthermore, the BC mass concentration exhibits a well-defined diurnal variation, with a morning peak and early afternoon minimum. The magnitude of the diurnal variations is seasonal dependent, which maximizes during the winter months. Air mass back trajectories indicated several different transport pathways, while the concentration weighted trajectory (CWT) analysis reveals that the most important potential sources for BC aerosols are the Indo-Gangetic plain (IGP), central India and some hot spots in Pakistan, Arabian Peninsula and Persian Gulf. The absorbing Angstrom exponent (alpha(abs)) estimated from the spectral values of absorption coefficient (sigma(abs)) ranges from 0.9 to 1.1 indicating high BC/OC ratio typical of fossil fuel origin. The annual average BC mass fraction to composite aerosols is found to be (10 +/- 3) % contributing to the atmospheric forcing by (55 +/- 10) %. The BC radiative forcing at the atmosphere shows strong seasonal dependency with higher values in winter (33.49 +/- 7.01) and spring (31.78 +/- 12.89) and moderate in autumn (18.94 +/- 6.71) and summer (13.15 +/- 1.66).

The dynamics of the particle number and mass emission rates are examined at resolved temporal and spatial scales across an urban arterial, a rural arterial and a divided freeway. Time-based particle number and mass emission rates were highest on the freeway, but the distance-based particle emission rates of emission/km at ""hot-spots"" for exposure assessment for selected 50-m road segments occurred at intersections when the bus accelerated from a stop or traveled up high grades. Comparisons of particle mass and number emission rates between idling and acceleration indicate that unless the bus is extending idling for several minutes, public exposure to bus particle emissions near bus stops can be mainly attributed to accelerations. Generally, particle number and mass emissions rates are highly correlated both temporally and spatially. Some deviations occur because particle mass emissions are highly elevated during sustained fueling events such as traveling on high grades and during sustained accelerations, while particle number emissions are more sensitive to fuel and engine speed fluctuations.

To overcome this challenge, Landsat imagery has been used as an effective tool to assess basic water-quality indicators, such as Secchi depth (SD), over a large region or to map more advanced lake attributes, such as cyanobacteria, for a single waterbody. The overarching objective of this research application was to evaluate Landsat Thematic Mapper (TM) for mapping nine water-quality metrics over a large region and to identify hot spots of potential risk. The second objective was to evaluate the addition of landscape pattern metrics to test potential improvements in mapping lake attributes and to understand drivers of lake water quality in this region. Field-level in situ water-quality measurements were collected across diverse lakes (n=42) within the Lower Peninsula of Michigan. A multicriteria statistical approach was executed to map lake water quality that considered variable importance, model complexity, and uncertainty. Overall, band ratio radiance models performed well (R-2 = 0.65-0.81) for mapping SD, chlorophyll-a, green biovolume, total phosphorus (TP), and total nitrogen (TN) with weaker (R-2 = 0.37) ability to map total suspended solids (TSS) and cyanobacteria levels. In this application, Landsat TM and pattern metrics showed poor ability to accurately map non-purgable organic carbon (NPOC) and diatom biovolume, likely due to a combination of gaps in temporal overpass and field sampling and lack of signal sensitivity within broad spectral channels of Landsat TM. The composition and configuration of croplands, urban, and wetland patches across the landscape were found to be moderate predictors of lake water quality that can complement lake remote-sensing data. Of the 4071 lakes, over 4 ha in the Lower Peninsula, approximately two-thirds, were identified as mesotrophic (n=2715). This application highlights how an operational tool might support lake decision-making or assessment protocols to identify hot spots of potential risk.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SUSPENDED MATTER CONCENTRATIONS;CHLOROPHYLL-A CONCENTRATION;CYANOBACTERIAL BLOOMS;THEMATIC MAPPER;SPOT DATA;BAY;REFLECTANCE;PHYCOCYANIN;WETLANDS;CLARITY;Imagery (Psychotherapy);Michigan,,

Although many efforts have been made to mitigate air pollution, the European air quality standards for atmospheric pollutants are frequently breached. This study investigates the levels of eight PM10-bound PAHs collected in 21 stations categorized as rural background, urban and suburban backgrounds, traffic and industrial hot-spots during one year (2011). Data were statistically processed to detect the PAH seasonal trends, their relationship with other air pollutants and micro-meteorological parameters and the space variations at a regional scale. Results show that PAHs levels are relatively high in the largest part of the region, with 10 sites exceeding the levels of BaP targeted by the European legislation. Two sites exhibited anomalously high PAHs concentrations and this anomaly became even more evident when considering the population density as a surrogate for the potential anthropogenic pressure. The PAHs levels were found directly proportional to other gaseous pollutants (CO, NO, NOx, SO2) suggesting common polluting sources. The analysis of time trends of PAH concentrations reveals significant coincidences throughout the region, i.e. simultaneous changes are observed in most sites as a consequence of similar emission sources and accumulation/removal processes. In this scenario, the control strategies currently imposed at local level (e.g. traffic limitations) have proven scarcely effective in mitigating air pollution and a real coordination at regional or even interregional level cannot be further postponed. Peculiar features of the PAHs pollution in the Veneto were also identified and some measures for protecting the human health were suggested. (C) 2013 Elsevier Ltd.

Despite previous attempts to measure campus safety, quantifying perceptions of fear, safety, and risk remains a challenging issue. Since perceptions of safety and incidents of crime do not necessarily mirror one another, both were utilized in this investigation. Purpose: The purpose of this article is to describe an innovative, mixed methods approach for assessing campus safety at a large, urban campus in the southeast region of the United States. Method: A concurrent triangulation design was implemented to allow investigators the opportunity to collect qualitative and quantitative data simultaneously and integrate results in the interpretation phase. Data were collected from four distinct sources of information. Results: Student focus groups yielded data regarding perceptions of risk, and kernel density analysis was used to identify hot spots of campus crime incidents. Conclusion: While in many cases perceived risk and actual crime incidents were associated, incidents of hot spots of each type occurred independently with such frequency that an overall correlation of the two was not significant. Accordingly, while no significant correlation between perceived risk and crime incidents was confirmed statistically, the geospatial integration of these data suggested three types of safety conditions. Further, the combination of focus group data and spatial analyses provided a more comprehensive and, therefore, more complete understanding of the multifaceted issues related to campus safety.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,PERCEPTIONS;WOMEN;VICTIMIZATION;BEHAVIORS;GENDER;CRIME,,

NO2 in troposphere is one of the key factors which determine the air quality and has serious implications on human health and plant growth. It is also well known for its indirect contribution to climate change. The identification of spatial and temporal variations of NO2 is necessary for any effective mitigation plan to curb its obnoxious abundance. Tropospheric NO2 measurements provided by the satellite remote sensor ""SCanning Imaging Absorption spectroMeter for Atmospheric CHartographY"" (SCIAMACHY) are utilized here to identify the regions across India where a concentration of NO2 exceeds the permissible healthy level. A new approach based on empirical approximation is attempted to normalize the unit of satellite measurement with the unit of existing air quality standard. Trend analysis for all the regions are carried out by means of a non-linear regression method. The geospatial and statistical analysis of monthly tropospheric NO2 data from the full operational period of SCIAMACHY (2002 August-2012 March) have resulted in the identification of 12 hot spot regions across India among which most of them exhibited a significant increasing trend.

This paper presents a study that focuses on the notion of creative capital (CC) and assesses its ability to foster economic development in Alaska. The findings suggest that some characteristics of the CC observed in Alaskan communities are similar to those found in southern regions, whereas others are distinct (but similar to those in the Canadian North). In Alaska, the synergy between cultural economy, entrepreneurship and leadership appear to be more important in characterising creative capacities than formal education. The geographical distribution of the CC is uneven and heavily clustered in economically, geographically and politically privileged northern urban centres. However, some remote regions also demonstrate considerable levels of creative potential, in particular associated with the aboriginal cultural capital (artists, crafters, etc.). A number of Alaskan regions, creative 'hot spots', could become places that can benefit from alternative strategies of regional development based on CC, knowledge-based and cultural economies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Economia",,DEVELOPMENT GEOGRAPHY;KNOWLEDGE;REGIONS;GROWTH;INNOVATION;FINLAND;CITIES;ISSUES;TALENT;Alaska,,

However, access to integrated care is limited to certain communities. Racial and ethnic minority and low-income communities may not have access to needed integrated care in large urban areas. Because the main principle of health care reform is to expand health insurance to low-income individuals to improve access to care and reduce health disparities among minorities, it is necessary to understand the extent to which integrated care is geographically accessible in minority and low-income communities.        Methods: National Survey of Substance Abuse Treatment Services data from 2010 were used to examine geographic availability of facilities offering integration of mental health services in SAT programs in Los Angeles County, California. Using geographic information systems (GIS), service areas were constructed for each facility (N = 402 facilities; 104 offering integrated services) representing the surrounding area within a 10-minute drive. Spatial autocorrelation analyses were used to derive hot spots (or clusters) of census tracts with high concentrations of African American, Asian, Latino, and low-income households. Access to integrated care was reflected by the hot spot coverage of each facility, i.e., the proportion of its service area that overlapped with each type of hot spot.        Results: GIS analysis suggested that ethnic and low-income communities have limited access to facilities offering integrated care; only one fourth of SAT providers offered integrated care. Regression analysis showed facilities whose service areas overlapped more with Latino hot spots were less likely to offer integrated care, as well as a potential interaction effect between Latino and high-poverty hot spots.        Conclusion: Despite significant pressure to enhance access to integrated services, ethnic and racial minority communities are disadvantaged in terms of proximity to this type of care. These findings can inform health care policy to increase geographic access to integrated care for the increasing number of clients with public health insurance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,COOCCURRING SUBSTANCE USE;MENTAL-HEALTH-SERVICES;DRUG-TREATMENT;ABUSE;DISPARITIES;DELIVERY;DISTANCE;ACCESS;AVAILABILITY;SPANISH,,

Reducing this sector's 'carbon footprint' can help to meet targets set under the Kyoto Protocol. Carbon dioxide emissions reduction is now a legal requirement under the UK's Climate Change Act; infrastructure clients therefore require their supply chains to provide carbon footprint information. A new, more holistic, project-specific carbon footprinting approach is urgently needed to account for carbon in an integrated manner, identifying areas of carbon hot spots and developing a reduction hierarchy to support business decision making. In this paper a process-based carbon footprinting framework based on the PAS2050:2011 protocol is adopted. Results of case studies (focusing on the carbon footprint) of 'typical' UK highway maintenance processes are provided, namely pavement resurfacing, pavement marking, bulk lamp changing and grass cutting. These processes were selected across urban, semi-urban and rural site locations to investigate the significance of these locations on the carbon footprint. The results indicate the robustness of the PAS2050-compliant framework for highway maintenance carbon footprinting; areas of carbon hotspots and related reduction opportunities can be identified to inform the reduction hierarchy across the processes value chain.

Nitrogen dioxide (NO2) released primarily from combustion processes, such as traffic, is a short-lived atmospheric pollutant that serves as an air-quality indicator and is itself a health concern. We derive a global distribution of ground-level NO2 concentrations from tropospheric NO2 columns retrieved from the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI). Local scaling factors from a three-dimensional chemistry-transport model (GEOS-Chem) are used to relate the OMI NO2 columns to ground-level concentrations. The OMI-derived surface NO2 data are significantly correlated (r = 0.69) with in situ surface measurements. We examine how the OMI-derived ground-level NO2 concentrations, OMI NO2 columns, and bottom-up NOx emission inventories relate to urban population. Emission hot spots, such as power plants, are excluded to focus on urban relationships. The correlation of surface NO2 with population is significant for the three countries and one continent examined here: United States (r = 0.71), Europe (r = 0.67), China (r = 0.69), and India (r = 0.59). Urban NO2 pollution, like other urban properties, is a power law scaling function of the population size: NO2 concentration increases proportional to population raised to an exponent. The value of the exponent varies by region from 0.36 for India to 0.66 for China, reflecting regional differences in industrial development and per capita emissions. It has been generally established that energy efficiency increases and, therefore, per capita NO emissions decrease with urban population; here, we show how outdoor ambient NO2 concentrations depend upon urban population in different global regions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,NITROGEN-OXIDE EMISSIONS;FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;AIR-POLLUTION;UNITED-STATES;GLOBAL BURDEN;POWER-PLANTS;OZONE;MORTALITY;DIOXIDE;AEROSOL;Urban Population;Population Density,,

Train-induced bridge vibration has been the subject of a number of investigations based on train-track-bridge coupling vibration theory, but the associated bridge-borne noise has received little attention. This paper presents a numerical simulation technique for high-frequency bridge vibration and the associated bridge-borne noise, which is then applied to a simply supported PC box-girder used in the Chengdu-Dujiangyan intercity railway. In an integrated finite element method-boundary element method (FEM-BEM) approach, the transient train-induced bridge vibration responses are first solved using a finite element method, and the steady responses of the sound pressure are then solved in the frequency domain using a boundary element method. The dynamic response of the bridge is taken to be the sound source, and the time-frequency transformation is performed by a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). The predicted results for vibration and noise are in good agreement with data from field measurements. The results show that the dominant frequency range for both vibration and noise for the PC box-girder is 40-100 Hz and that there are significant tonal noise characteristics at 50 Hz. There are two noise ""hot spots"" beside the bridge, with complex directional properties. Finally, the effects of ground reflection and train speed on bridge-borne noise are discussed, based on the proposed acoustic computational procedure.

We developed a framework to estimate the spatial distribution and temporal dynamics of soil moisture and soil oxygen in surficial soils to scale nitrogen transformations for a forested watershed (Pond Branch) in Maryland, USA. We sampled soil cores in upland, hillslope hollow, riparian hollow, and riparian hummock landscape positions in different seasons for biogeochemical fluxes including measurement of N-2 gas produced via denitrification. We extrapolated these rates in space and time with information derived from in situ soil oxygen and soil moisture probes to scale fluxes from plots to the catchment level. We addressed three questions: (1) How important are seasonal, daily, and storm event variations in soil oxygen for denitrification? (2) How is denitrification spatially distributed through the watershed? (3) How important is denitrification to the watershed nitrogen budget? We found that microtopography within the riparian zone is a significant influence on soil oxygen dynamics and therefore redox-sensitive biogeochemical processes such as denitrification. Riparian zone hollows (lower topographic positions) represented 0.5%-1.0% of the catchment area, but accounted for >99% of total denitrification. Interestingly, topography was a much stronger controller of oxygen than rainfall, which had little influence on temporal variation in soil oxygen levels. Spatial and temporal extrapolations of measured rates suggest that a minimum of 16%-27% of atmospheric nitrogen deposition is lost to denitrification. These results suggest that the importance of denitrification in the nitrogen budget of forested watersheds depends fundamentally on the presence of landscape elements, such as riparian hollows that function as hot spots of activity.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SOIL-NITROGEN;FOREST SOILS;NITRATE;CARBON;TERRESTRIAL;REMOVAL;URBAN;MODELS;FLUX;BIOGEOCHEMISTRY;Nitrogen,,

However, a subset of cities is experiencing a decline in population, which often manifests in the abandonment of residential structures. These vacant and abandoned structures pose a land use challenge to urban planners, and a key question has been how to manage these properties. Often times land use management of these structures takes the form of demolition, but the elimination of infrastructures and can have unknown and sometimes unintended effects on the human-environment interactions in urban areas. This paper examines the association between demolitions and crime, a human-environment interaction that is fostered by vacant and abandoned properties, through a comparative statistical analysis. A cluster analysis is performed to identify high and low hot spots of demolition and crime activity, specifically assault, drug arrests, and prostitution, over a 5-year period. Results show that there is an association between the area targeted for significant demolition activity and the migration of spatial patterns of certain crimes. The direction of crime movement toward the edges of the city limits and in the direction of the first ring suburbs highlights the importance of regional planning when implementing land use policies for smart decline in shrinking cities.

The study was designed to link TP concentrations with relevant water quality parameters and remote sensing reflectance bands in aquatic environments using in-situ data from a local database to support the calibration and validation of the GP model. The GP models show the effective capacity to demonstrate snapshots of spatiotemporal distributions of TP across the Bay, which helps to delineate the short-term seasonality effects and the decadal trends of TP in an environmentally sensitive coastal bay area. In the past decade, urban development and agricultural activities in the Bay area have substantially increased the use of fertilizers. Landfall hurricanes, including Frances and Jeanne in 2004 and Wilma in 2005, followed by continuous droughts from 2006 to 2008 in South Florida, made the Bay area an ideal place for a remote sensing impact assessment. A changing hydrological cycle, triggered by climate variations, exhibited unique regional patterns of varying TP waste loads into the Bay over different time scales ranging from seasons to years. With the aid of the derived GP model in this study, we were able to explore these multiple spatiotemporal distributions of TP concentrations in the Tampa Bay area aquatic environment and to elucidate these coupled dynamic impacts induced by both natural hazards and anthropogenic perturbations. This advancement enables us to identify the hot moments and hot spots of TP concentrations in the Tampa Bay region. (c) 2013 Elsevier Inc.

Sub national information on tick distribution, ecology and vector status is often lacking. However, precise location of infection risk can lead to better targeted prevention measures, surveillance and control.        Methods: In this context, the current paper compiled geolocated tick occurrences in Belgium, a country where tick-borne disease has received little attention, in order to highlight the potential value of spatial approaches and draw some recommendations for future research priorities.        Results: Mapping of 89,289 ticks over 654 sites revealed that ticks such as Ixodes ricinus and Ixodes hexagonus are largely present while Dermacentor reticulatus has a patchy distribution. Suspected hot spots of tick diversity might favor pathogen exchanges and suspected hot spots of I. ricinus abundance might increase human-vector contact locally. This underlines the necessity to map pathogens and ticks in detail. While I. ricinus is the main vector, I. hexagonus is a vector and reservoir of Borrelia burgdorferi s.l., which is active the whole year and is also found in urban settings. This and other nidiculous species bite humans less frequently, but seem to harbour pathogens. Their role in maintaining a pathogenic cycle within the wildlife merits investigation as they might facilitate transmission to humans if co-occurring with I. ricinus. Many micro-organisms are found abroad in tick species present in Belgium. Most have not been recorded locally but have not been searched for. Some are transmitted directly at the time of the bite, suggesting promotion of tick avoidance additionally to tick removal.        Conclusion: This countrywide approach to tick-borne diseases has helped delineate recommendations for future research priorities necessary to design public health policies aimed at spatially integrating the major components of the ecological cycle of tick-borne diseases. A systematic survey of tick species and associated pathogens is called for in Europe, as well as better characterisation of species interaction in the ecology of tick-borne diseases, those being all tick species, pathogens, hosts and other species which might play a role in tick-borne diseases complex ecosystems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,BURGDORFERI SENSU-LATO;IXODES-RICINUS TICKS;BORRELIA-BURGDORFERI;DERMACENTOR-RETICULATUS;ANAPLASMA-PHAGOCYTOPHILUM;RHIPICEPHALUS-SANGUINEUS;LYME BORRELIOSIS;ARGAS-REFLEXUS;BABESIA-MICROTI;UNITED-KINGDOM;Ticks;Belgium,,

Fetal alcohol syndrome (FAS) is common in parts of South Africa; rural residence is a frequently cited risk factor. We conducted a FAS school prevalence survey of an isolated rural community in a West Coast village of Western Cape Province, so obtaining the first directly measured rate, focusing specifically on a South African rural area, of FAS and partial FAS (PFAS).        Methods. The study area (Aurora village), a community of about 2 500 people in a grain-producing region, has one primary school. All learners were eligible for study inclusion. Initial anthropometry screening was followed by a diagnostic stage entailing examination by a dysmorphologist for features of FAS, neurodevelopmental assessment, and an interview assessing maternal alcohol consumption.        Results. Of 160 learners screened, 78 (49%) were screen-positive, of whom 63 (81%) were clinically assessed for FAS. The overall FAS/PFAS rate among the screened learners was 17.5% (95% confidence interval 12.0 - 24.2%), with 16 (10.0%) children having FAS and 12 (7.5%) PFAS. High rates of stunting, underweight and microcephaly were noted in all learners, especially those with FAS or PFAS. Five (18%) mothers of affected children were deceased by the time of assessment.        Conclusion. We describe very high rates of FAS/PFAS in an isolated rural part of the Western Cape that is not located in a viticultural region. Our study suggests that the prevalence of FA S may be very high in isolated communities, or in particular hot-spots. It adds to the growing evidence that FAS/PFAS is a significant, and underestimated, health problem in South Africa.

Under the investigated conditions, UV disinfection process resulted in a total inactivation after 60 min of irradiation (1.25 x 10(4) mu W s cm(-2)) compared to 120 min chlorine contact time (initial chlorine dose of 2 mg L-1). Moreover, no change in E. coli strains' resistance to amoxicillin (AMX) (minimum inhibiting concentration (MIC) > 256 mg L-1) and sulfamethoxazole (SMZ) (MIC > 1024 mg L-1) could be observed after UV treatment, while the treatment affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to ciprofloxacin (CPX) (MIC decreased by 33% and 50% after 60 and 120 min, respectively). Contrarily, chlorination process did not affect antibiotic resistance of the investigated E. coli strains. Finally, the effect of UV radiation on the mixture of three antibiotics was also investigated and photodegradation data fit quite well pseudo first order kinetic models with rip values of 14, 20 and 25 min for CPX, AMX and SMZ, respectively. According to these results, conventional disinfection processes may not be effective in the inactivation of ARB, and the simultaneous release of ARB and antibiotics at sub-lethal concentrations into UWWTP effluent may promote the development of resistance among bacteria in receiving water.

Seasonal linear regression models between 1-km retrieved MODIS AOT data and ground PM10 measurements were developed for the PRD region with meteorological corrections, and were subjected to a validation against observations from the regional air monitoring network in this region from 2006 to 2008, with an overall error of less than 50%. Consistent with ground observations, the estimated PM10 concentrations from the regression models appeared to be highest in winter, lower in autumn and spring, and lowest in summer. A high PM10 concentration band was detected over the inner part of the PRD region, where heavy industries and dense populations are located. The shape and concentration levels of this band exhibit significant seasonal variations, which shift with synoptic wind direction, indicating different source regions and their contributions to the PM10 pollution in the PRD region. Several discrete ""hot spots"" were found in the southwest of the PRD region during spring and other seasons, where no ground measurements are available. The reasons for the formation of these hot spots are unclear, and further investigations are needed. Despite the limitations of this work, the results demonstrate the effectiveness of retrieving remote sensing data for characterizing regional aerosol pollution, together with ground measurements. The combination of satellite data and ground monitoring presented in this work can help in better understanding the sources, formation mechanisms and transport process of particulate matters on a regional scale.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"FINE PARTICULATE MATTER;URBAN AIR-POLLUTION;CHEMICAL-COMPOSITIONS;SATELLITE;QUALITY;SITES;PM2.5;RESOLUTION;DEPTH;LAND;Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2",,

This method is a set of GIS spatial statistical techniques that are useful in describing and visualizing the spatial distribution, detecting patterns of hot-spots, and suggesting spatial regimes. The global Moran's I statistics for inbound and domestic tourist flows reveal strong positive and significant spatial autocorrelation. Furthermore, the Moran significance maps indicate four significant inbound tourism hot-spot areas in 1999 and 2006 (the Beijing-Tianjin cluster, the Yangtze River Delta cluster, the Fujian coast cluster and the Pearl River Delta cluster), and five significant domestic tourism hot-spot areas in 2002 and 2006 (with the addition of the Chengdu cluster). Based on the results, we show that tourism flows are polarized into clusters and remain very stable over time. As has been seen in other countries, hot-spots tend to be in insular and coastal areas, and associated with cities that are higher in China's urban hierarchy. Implications are drawn, such as priority of resource allocations for hot-spot area and the utilization of spillover effects from hot-spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Economia,Ambiental",,PATTERNS;EUROPE;CYCLE;China,,

Ninety four PM10 samples were collected during the dry and wet seasons of 2010 and the dry season of 2011 in Chiang Mai, Thailand, and analyzed for 16 PAHs by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The average PM10 concentrations were 104.91 +/- 32.70, 13.28 +/- 11.34 and 36.24 +/- 19.16 mu g/m(3) in dry season of 2010, wet season of 2010 and dry season of 2011, respectively, while the average 16-PAHs concentrations were 25.87 +/- 10.13, 3.12 +/- 2.18 and 4.58 +/- 2.18 ng/m(3), respectively. Correlations of PM10 and total PAHs concentrations were relatively high during all seasons (r> 0.796). In addition, PM10 concentrations were highly correlated with carcinogenic PAHs (r= 0.927) during the dry season of 2010, indicating that carcinogenic compounds were dominant in the particulate PAHs and could be generated from open burning, usually conducted in the dry season. The average PM10 concentration in the dry season of 2011 was much lower than that in 2010 and lower than the annual average of the past 12 years (48.17 mu g/m(3)) because of the unusually high amount of rain precipitation and low open burning activity in this year. According to the accumulated number of hot spots occurring in northern part of Thailand, approximately 19,000 spots were found in the dry season of 2010, while only 6,600 spots were found in the dry season of 2011. It can be seen that larger scale open burning activities were performed in the dry season of 2010 than in the dry season of 2011. The value of toxicity equivalent concentration from PAHs in the dry season of 2010 was higher than that of the wet season of 2010 and the dry season of 2011. This is obviously related to concentrations of PM10 and PAHs. Diagnostic ratio and principal component analysis were used to find out the sources of PM10-bound PAHs. It was found that vehicle emission and biomass burning were the main sources of PM10 and PAHs in this area. The high ratio value of benzo(a) anthracene/chrysene (BaA/CHR) in the dry season of 2010 indicated possible photochemical processes and long distance emissions. Findings on source identification of PM10 and PAHs were found to be relevant to the direction and speed of air mass movement run by backward trajectory. (C) 2013 Elsevier B.V.

However, the drivers of national-scale patterns of fire occurrence are not well understood, and how the relative importance of human or biophysical factors varies across the country is unclear. Our research goal was to model the drivers of fire occurrence within ecoregions across the conterminous United States. We used generalized linear models to compare the relative influence of human, vegetation, climate, and topographic variables on fire occurrence in the United States, as measured by MODIS active fire detections collected between 2000 and 2006. We constructed models for all fires and for large fires only and generated predictive maps to quantify fire occurrence probabilities. Areas with high fire occurrence probabilities were widespread in the Southeast, and localized in the Mountain West, particularly in southern California, Arizona, and New Mexico. Probabilities for large-fire occurrence were generally lower, but hot spots existed in the western and south-central United States The probability of fire occurrence is a critical component of fire risk assessments, in addition to vegetation type, fire behavior, and the values at risk. Many of the hot spots we identified have extensive development in the wildland-urban interface and are near large metropolitan areas. Our results demonstrated that human variables were important predictors of both all fires and large fires and frequently exhibited nonlinear relationships. However, vegetation, climate, and topography were also significant variables in most ecoregions. If recent housing growth trends and fire occurrence patterns continue, these areas will continue to challenge policies and management efforts seeking to balance the risks generated by wildfires with the ecological benefits of fire.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,WILDLAND-URBAN INTERFACE;NET PRIMARY PRODUCTION;LANDSCAPE PATTERNS;CLIMATE-CHANGE;VEGETATION DISTRIBUTION;RELATIVE IMPORTANCE;NORTHERN        WISCONSIN;HOUSING GROWTH;PINE FORESTS;LEAF-AREA;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;United States,,

Herbivorous arthropod Pests are often more abundant in urban than in rural areas,. and urban outbreaks have been attributed to reduced control by predators and parasitoids and to increased susceptibility of stressed urban plants. These hypotheses, however, leave many outbreaks unexplained and fail to predict variation in pest abundance within cities. Here we show that the abundance of a common insect pest is positively related to temperature even when controlling for other habitat characteristics The scale insect Parthenolecanium quercifex was 13 times more abundant on willow oak trees in the hottest parts of Raleigh, NC, in the southeastern United States, than in cooler areas, though parasitism rates were similar. We further separated the effects of heat from those of natural enemies and plant quality in a greenhouse reciprocal transplant experiment. P. quercifex collected from hot urban trees became more abundant in hot greenhouses than in cool greenhouses, whereas the abundance of P. quercifex collected from cooler urban trees remained low in hot and cool greenhouses. Parthenolecanium quercifex living in urban hot spots succeed with warming, and they do so because some demes have either acclimatized or adapted to high temperatures. Our results provide the first evidence that heat can be a key driver of insect pest outbreaks on urban trees. Since urban warming is similar in magnitude to global warming predicted in the next 50 years, pest abundance on city trees may foreshadow widespread outbreaks as natural forests also grow warmer.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,NATURAL ENEMIES;LAND-USE;TEMPERATURE;WATER;HOMOPTERA;PLANT;SIZE;URBANIZATION;CONSEQUENCES;RESPONSES;Trees,,

Events tend to happen in the evenings - nights, holidays and weekends - and, at least for theft, in the hotter months of the year. Although the highest number of events is found in the central station, the so-called 'end-stations' show often higher rates than those located in the inner city. Results show that opportunities for crime are dependent on stations' environmental attributes, type of neighbourhood in which they are located and city context. These findings lend weight to principles of traditional urban criminology theory such as routine activity and social disorganisation.

An examination of the history of urban planning and expansion reveals a fundamental paradox, for it became apparent very early on that living space does not lend itself so readily to planning. Although the rise of suburbs is usually associated with the nineteenth century, a few ""early bloomers"" can be identified in urban history. Architects such as Antoine-Michel Perrache and Jean-Antoine Morand, who designed expansion projects in the south and in the east of the city of Lyon, became veritable city planners, if not choreographers, of the suburbs. However, the projects were not realized - at least partially - for nearly another 100 years (when the initiators were long dead). The history of planning and realizing the urban periphery thus resembles a dialectical movement of spatial visions and partial failure, entailing temporal setbacks which lead to a synthesis of the half-planned and half-unforeseen. Yet theories of the production of space offer insufficient explanations of the complex spatio-temporality of urbanization processes. Using the example of the Lyon projects, the essay argues that a description of processes of urban expansion must take into account such temporal phenomena as vision, retrospection, hope, and delay.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Economia",,"",,

Our study investigated groundwater filtered total mercury (THg) andmethylmercury (MeHg) dynamics in three riparian zones with contrasting hydrogeomorphic (HGM) characteristics (till, alluvium, outwash) in the US Midwest. Despite high Hg deposition rates (>16 mg m(-2)) in the region, median THg (<1.05 ng L-1) and MeHg (<0.05 ng L-1) concentrations were low at the study sites. Methylmercury concentrations were significantly (p < 0.05) correlated to THg (R = 0.82), temperature (R = 0.55), and dissolved organic carbon (DOC) (R = 0.62). THg also correlated with groundwater DOC (R = 0.59). The proportion of MeHg in THg (%MeHg) was significantly correlated to temperature (R = 0.58) and MeHg (R = 0.50). Results suggest that HGM characteristics, the presence of tile drains, and the propensity for overbank flooding at a riparian site determined the extent to which stream water Hg concentrations influenced riparian groundwater Hg levels or vice versa. Differences in hydrogeomorphic characteristics between sites did not translate however in significant differences in groundwater MeHg or %MeHg. Overall, widespread Hg contamination in the most common riparian hydrogeomorphic types of the US Midwest is unlikely to be a major concern. However, for frequently flooded riparian zones located downstream from a potentially large source of Hg (e. g., concentrated urban development), Hg concentrations are likely to be higher than at other sites.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,NET METHYLMERCURY PRODUCTION;NITROGEN TRANSFORMATIONS;METHYL MERCURY;HOT-SPOTS;WATER;NITRATE;WETLANDS;DENITRIFICATION;HYDROLOGY;TRANSPORT;Midwestern United States,,

The authors examine whether activities patrol officers were conducting might have produced the crime reduction. The activities of foot and car patrol officers research takes a closer look at what types are examined separately and differences between car patrol activities pre-intervention and during the intervention are explored. Activities of foot versus car patrol officers during the study period are compared across treatment and control areas.        Design/methodology/approach - Official data on police officer activity are used to compare activities conducted by foot patrol officers with those by car patrol officers in 60 treatment (foot beat) and 60 control areas consisting of violent crime hot spots. Activities of car patrol officers are described pre-intervention and during the intervention. Foot patrol officers' activities are described within treatment and control areas during the treatment phase of the experiment. Car patrol officers' activities are reported separately. The statistical significance of changes in car patrol activity pre and during intervention is evaluated using a series of mixed model ANOVAs.        Findings - There were noticeable differences in the activities conducted by foot and car patrol. Foot patrol officers spent most of their time initiating pedestrian stops and addressing disorder incidents, while car patrol officers handled the vast majority of reported crime incidents. Car patrol activity declined in both treatment and control areas during the intervention but there was no statistically significant difference between the treatment and the control areas.        Research limitations/implications - The major limitation of this study is the restricted set of data describing officer activity that is captured by official records. Future studies should include a more robust ethnographic component to better understand the broad spectrum of police activity in order to more effectively gauge the ways in which foot patrol and car-based officers' activities interact to address community safety. This understanding can help extend the literature on ""co-production"" by highlighting the safety partnerships that may develop organically across individual units within a police organization.        Practical implications - The study provides evidence that individual policing strategies undertaken by agencies impact one another. When implementing and evaluating new programs, it would be beneficial for police managers and researchers to consider the impact on activities of the dominant patrol style, as necessary, to understand how a specific intervention might have achieved its goal or why it might have failed to show an effect.        Originality/value - The research contributes to the understanding of the separate and joint effects of foot and car patrol on crime. In addition, it provides police managers with a clearer picture of the ways in which foot patrol police and car-based officers work to co-produce community safety in violent inner-city areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,POLICE;ADVOCATE;Crime;Foot,,

Almost 600 possums were observed as road-kill, with common ringtail possums (Pseudocheirus peregrinus) encountered in 87% of surveys and almost three times as often as common brushtail possums (Trichosurus vulpecula) (encountered in 52% of surveys). Roads were classified into three categories based on adjacent landscape attributes, with the road-side environment ranging from suburban housing to continuous sclerophyll forest. Clusters, or 'hot spots', for possum road-kill were identified using GIS. Most possum fatalities, and five out of six hot spots, occurred along roads at the bush-urban interface, suggesting high possum movement rates and/or abundance at these sites. Continuous canopy across the road was available along only 4% of the roads surveyed, forcing these arboreal marsupials to cross roads via electricity wires or at ground level, making them vulnerable to collision with vehicles. In an attempt to mitigate the possum road toll, two rope tunnel bridges were erected at canopy level above the most consistent hot spot. Subsequent monitoring of the roads was undertaken for 10 months after erection of the canopy bridge and road-kill numbers declined significantly at the site of the bridges, but also at adjacent sites throughout the study area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,"NEW-SOUTH-WALES;CROSSING STRUCTURES;WILDLIFE;MAMMALS;AUSTRALIA;ABUNDANCE;IMPACTS;PERFORMANCE;POPULATION;MITIGATION;Homosexuality, Male",,

Soc. Rev., 2008, 37, 699, Harrison et al., Sci. Total Environ., 2006, 360, 5, Gab et al., Nature, 1985, 316, 535, ref. 1-3). Recently it was shown that small Criegee intermediates, C.I.'s, react far more rapidly with SO2 than typically represented in tropospheric models, (Welz, Science, 2012, 335, 204, ref. 4) which suggested that carbonyl oxides could have a substantial influence on the atmospheric oxidation of SO2. Oxidation of SO2 is the main atmospheric source of sulphuric acid (H2SO4), which is a critical contributor to aerosol formation, although questions remain about the fundamental nucleation mechanism (Sipila et al., Science, 2010, 327, 1243, Metzger et al., Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A., 2010 107, 6646, Kirkby et al., Nature, 2011, 476, 429, ref. 5-7). Non-absorbing atmospheric aerosols, by scattering incoming solar radiation and acting as cloud condensation nuclei, have a cooling effect on climate (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC), Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis, Cambridge University Press, 2007, ref. 8). Here we explore the effect of the Criegees on atmospheric chemistry, and demonstrate that ozonolysis of alkenes via the reaction of Criegee intermediates potentially has a large impact on atmospheric sulphuric acid concentrations and consequently the first steps in aerosol production. Reactions of Criegee intermediates with SO2 will compete with and in places dominate over the reaction of OH with SO2 (the only other known gas-phase source of H2SO4) in many areas of the Earth's surface. In the case that the products of Criegee intermediate reactions predominantly result in H2SO4 formation, modelled particle nucleation rates can be substantially increased by the improved experimentally obtained estimates of the rate coefficients of Criegee intermediate reactions. Using both regional and global scale modelling, we show that this enhancement is likely to be highly variable spatially with local hot-spots in e. g. urban outflows. This conclusion is however contingent on a number of remaining uncertainties in Criegee intermediate chemistry.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SECONDARY ORGANIC AEROSOL;GAS-PHASE OZONOLYSIS;TORCH 2003 CAMPAIGN;PARTICLE FORMATION;CRI MECHANISM;TROPOSPHERIC OZONE;BETA-PINENE;CHEMISTRY;MODEL;NUCLEATION;Aerosols,,

A binary choice model is used to link the outcome to a set of factors that characterize the risk of the sites under analysis on the basis of two categories (0/1) for the dependent variable. The proposed methodology consists of two main steps. After a threshold value for the number of accidents is set to distinguish hot spots from safe sites (Category 1 or 0, respectively), a binary model based on this classification is applied. This model allows the construction of a site list ordered by using the probability of a site's being a hot spot. In the second step, the selection strategy can target a fixed number of sites with the greatest probability or all sites exceeding a specific probability, such as .5. To demonstrate the proposed methodology, simulated urban intersection data from Porto, Portugal, covering 5 years are used. The results of the binary model show a good fit. To evaluate and compare the probabilistic method with other commonly used methods, the performance of each method is tested by its power to detect true hot spots. The test results indicate the superiority of the proposed method. This method is simple to apply, and critical issues such as assumptions of a prior distribution effect and the regression-to-the-mean phenomenon are overcome. Further, the model provides a realistic and intuitive perspective.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Simulação de Cenários | USER-NOTES: {""Fagner ""=>[""Muito interessante""]}",,RANKING;PARAMETER,,

Texas 2-1-1 is a disaster communication hub between callers with unmet needs and community services at disaster sites and evacuation destinations.        Purpose: To describe the location and timing of unmet disaster needs collected in real-time through Katrina-Rita disaster phases.        Methods: In 2008-2010, a total of 25 data sets of Texas 2-1-1 calls from August-December 2005 were recoded and merged. In 2011-2012, analysis was performed of unmet need types, with comparisons over time and location; mapping was adjusted by population size.        Results: Of 635,983 total 2-1-1 calls during the study period, 65% included primary disaster unmet needs: housing/shelter (28%); health/safety (18%); food/water (15%); transportation/fuel (4%). Caller demand spiked on Mondays, decreasing to a precipitous drop on weekends and holidays. Unmet needs surged during evacuation and immediate disaster response, remaining at higher threshold through recovery. Unmet need volume was concentrated in metropolitan areas. After adjusting for population size, ""hot-spots"" showed in smaller evacuation destinations and along evacuation routes.        Conclusions: New disaster management strategies and policies are needed for evacuation destinations to support extended evacuation and temporary or permanent relocation. Planning and monitoring disaster resources for unmet needs over time and location could be targeted effectively using real-time 2-1-1 call patterns. Smaller evacuation communities were more vulnerable, exhausting their limited resources more quickly. Emergency managers should devise systems to more quickly authorize vouchers and reimbursements. As 2-1-1s expand and coordinate disaster roles nationwide, opportunities exist for analysis of unmet disaster needs to improve disaster management and enhance community resiliency.

The examined antibiotics were ofloxacin (OFX) and trimethoprim (TMP). A compound parabolic collector (CPC) pilot plant was used for the photocatalytic experiments. The process was mainly evaluated by a fast and reliable analytical method based on a UPLC-MS/MS system. Solar photo-Fenton process using low iron and hydrogen peroxide doses ([Fe2+](0) = 5 mg L-1; [H2O2](0) = 75 mg L-1) was proved to be an efficient method for the elimination of these compounds with relatively high degradation rates. The photocatalytic degradation of OFX and TMP with the solar photo-Fenton process followed apparent first-order kinetics. A modification of the first-order kinetic expression was proposed and has been successfully used to explain the degradation kinetics of the compounds during the solar photo-Fenton treatment. The results demonstrated the capacity of the applied advanced process to reduce the initial wastewater toxicity against the examined plant species (Sorghum saccharatum, Lepidium sativum, Sinapis alba) and the water flea Daphnia magna. The phytotoxicity of the treated samples, expressed as root growth inhibition, was higher compared to that observed on the inhibition of seed germination. Enterococci, including those resistant to OFX and TMP, were completely eliminated at the end of the treatment. The total cost of the full scale unit for the treatment of 150 m(3) day(-1) of secondary wastewater effluent was found to be 0.85 (sic) m(-3). (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

Thermodynamic integration, based on molecular dynamics simulation in CHARMM, was used to determine the free energy associated with single point mutations to glycine in a protein-protein interface. The hot spot amino acids found in this way were then correlated to structural similarity scores detected by the ProBiS algorithm for local structural alignment. We find that amino acids with high structural similarity scores contribute on average -3.19 kcal/mol to the free energy of protein-protein binding and are thus correlated with hot spot residues, while residues with low similarity scores contribute on average only -0.43 kcal/mol. This suggests that the local structural alignment method provides a good approximation of the contribution of a residue to the free energy of binding and is particularly useful for detection of hot spots in proteins with known structures but undetermined protein-protein complexes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,MOLECULAR-DYNAMICS SIMULATIONS;BINDING-SITES PREDICTION;EMPIRICAL        FORCE-FIELD;WEB SERVER;LIGAND-BINDING;NUCLEIC-ACIDS;REGIONS;DNA;IDENTIFICATION;STABILITY,,

Both are minority-dominant, impoverished communities. We collected 24-h integrated personal air samples from 54 WFS residents and 53 CDS residents, with one sample on a weekday and one on a weekend day during the summer and winter seasons of 2004-2006. Ambient air samples from the center of each community were also collected simultaneously during personal air sampling. Toluene, ethylbenzene, and xylenes (TEX) presented higher (p < 0.05) ambient levels in WFS than in CDS, particularly during weekdays. A stronger association between personal and ambient concentrations of MTBE and TEX was found in WFS than in CDS. Fourteen to forty-two percent of the variation in personal MTBE, hexane, benzene, and TEX was explained by local outdoor air pollution. These observations indicated that local sources impacted the community air pollution and personal exposure in WFS. The estimated cancer risks resulting from two locally emitted VOCs, benzene and ethylbenzene, and non-cancer neurological and respiratory effects resulting from hexane, benzene, toluene, and xylenes exceeded the US EPA risk benchmarks in both communities. These findings emphasized the need to address disparity in health risks associated with ambient air pollution for the socio-economically disadvantaged groups.

Methods: We conducted a population-based, ecological-level study using the Ontario Asthma Surveillance Information System Database (OASIS), a validated registry of all Ontario residents with asthma. Data were mapped and analyzed at the sub-Local Health Integration Network (subLHIN) level (n=141). Comparative morbidity figures (CMFs) were calculated and analyzed for local clusters of high and low values (""hot spots"" and ""cold spots""). Results: There were 1,601,353 individuals identified as having asthma over the study period, representing an overall prevalence rate of 12.93%.        Results demonstrate distinct spatial patterns of asthma prevalence across the province which are age-and sex-specific. There was little overlap between asthma hot spots by age group, suggesting that different spatial processes are at play. Patterns of cold spots are consistently seen in the urban and suburban subLHINs in and around Toronto and Hamilton as well as in several of the highly rural northern subLHINs.

The paper presented is a piece of exploratory research. The overall aim is to develop a spatial vulnerability approach to address earthquake risk, using a semi-quantitative model. The model uses the analytical framework of a spatial GIS-based multi-criteria analysis. For this approach, we have chosen Bucharest, the capital city of Romania, based on its high vulnerability to earthquakes due to a rapid urban growth and the advanced state of decay of the buildings (most of the building stock were built between 1940 and 1977). The spatial result reveals a circular pattern, pinpointing as hot spots the Bucharest historic centre (located on a meadow and river terrace, and with aged building stock) and peripheral areas (isolated from the emergency centers and defined by precarious social and economic conditions). In a sustainable development perspective, the example of Bucharest shows how spatial patterns shape the ""vulnerability profile"" of the city, based on which decision makers could develop proper prediction and mitigation strategies and enhance the resilience of cities against the risks resulting from the earthquake hazard.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SOCIAL VULNERABILITY;RISK PERCEPTION;CLIMATE-CHANGE;GENDER;AHP;MEGACITIES;FRAMEWORK;GEOGRAPHY;STRESS;PEOPLE,,

The soil was taken from a park in Wilmington, DE, which had been an important center for the leather tanning industry along the Atlantic seaboard of the United States, until the early 20th century. Soil concentrations of As, Cr, and Pb measured at certain locations in the park greatly exceeded the background levels of these heavy metals in the State of Delaware. Results show that Cr(III) and As(V) species are mainly present in the soil, with insignificant amounts of Cr(VI) and As(III). Micro-XRF maps show that Cr and Fe are distributed together in regions where their concentrations are diffuse, and at local spots where their concentrations are high. Iron oxides, which can reduce Cr(VI) to Cr(III), are present at some of these hot spots where Cr and Fe are highly concentrated. Arsenic is mainly associated with Al in the soil, and to a minor extent with Fe. Arsenate may be sorbed to aluminum oxides, which might have transformed after a long period of time into an As-Al precipitate phase, having a structure and chemical composition similar to mansfieldite (AlAsO4 center dot 2H(2)O). The latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that only a small amount of As present in the soil was desorbed using the characteristic toxicity leaching procedure tests. This suggests that As is immobilized in the soil. (C) 2012 Elsevier Ltd.

In order to study the historical patterns of sprawl, there is a need to quantitatively and geographically depict the extent and density of impervious surface for three time periods of 1980, 1990, and 2000 for the entire state of Missouri. We mapped impervious surface using Sub-pixel Classifier (TM), an add-on module of Erdas Imagine for the three time periods, where impervious surface growth was derived as the subtraction of impervious surface mapped from the different time periods. Accuracy assessment was performed by comparing satellite derived impervious surface images with ground-truth acquired from high resolution air photos. Results show that during 1980-2000, 129,853 ha of land were converted to impervious surface. Sprawl was prominent on urban fringe (within the urban boundaries) during 1980s with 23,674 ha of land converted to impervious surface compared to 22,918 ha in 1990s. There was a temporal shift in the rural landscapes (outside the urban boundaries) in the 1990s with 48,079 ha of land converted to impervious surface compared to 35,180 ha in 1980s.

Additionally, since UWWTP effluents are possible sources of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria, the disinfection by conventional chlorination process of the UWWTP effluent inoculated with MDR strains was investigated too. Solar radiation poorly affected the inactivation of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (40 and 60% after 180 min irradiation). Moreover, solar radiation did not affect strain resistance to AMX (MIC > 256 mu g/mL) and SMZ (MIC > 1024 mu g/mL), but affected resistance of the lower resistance strain to CPX (MIC decreased by 33% but only after 180 min of irradiation). Chlorination of wastewater sample strongly decreased the number of the two selected antibiotic resistant E. coli strains (99.667 and 99.999%), after 60 min of contact time at 2.0 mg/L initial chlorine concentration, but the resistance of survived colonies to antibiotics was unchanged. Finally, the solar photodegradation rate of the antibiotic mixture (1 mg/L initial concentration respectively) resulted in the following order (half-life time): CPX (t(1/2) = 24 min)< AMX (t(1/2) = 99 min)< SMZ (t(1/2) = 577 min).

Materials and methods Organochlorine pesticides (OCs) and polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) were measured in sediments collected from 12 sampling sites (C1-C12) of sewage discharge to the sea from the wastewater treatment plant of Cortiou-Marseille. This study aims to determine the extent of these compounds in the sediments and to establish the possible sources of these contaminants.        Results and discussion Total pesticides in the sediments ranged from 1.2 to 190.6 ng g(-1) dry weight of sediment. The highest value was found at station C1, with a decreasing trend in total OC concentrations seaward. Among these compounds, the concentrations of the sum of dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (aDDT) were the highest, ranging from 0.7 to 114.3 ng g(-1). PCB concentrations, expressed as equivalent to Arochlor 1260, varied from 9.1 to 226.9 ng g(-1). Individually, the dominant coplanar PCB congeners CB-153, CB-138 and CB-101. Generally, PCB concentrations at stations C2, C3, C5 and C7 were higher than those at stations C10, C11 and C12. Through some pollution indices, we showed the long-term contamination input of these OCs (DDT, endosulfan, HCH and heptachlor cases) rather than a recent release resulting from degradation and long-term weathering (dieldrin, aldrin and methoxychlor cases).

A standardised methodology to assess these impacts in order to produce comparable results is still lacking. We propose a semi-quantitative approach to calculate vulnerability to climate change, with the ability to capture complex mechanisms in human-environmental systems. The key mechanisms are delineated and translated into a deterministic graph (impact chain). A fuzzy logic algorithm is then applied to address uncertainty regarding the definition of clear threshold values. We exemplify our approach by analysing the direct impacts of climate change on human health in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany, where the urban heat island potential, the percentage of elderly population as well as the occurrence of heat waves determine impact intensity. Increases in heatwaves and elderly population will aggravate the impacts. While the influence of climatic changes is apparent on larger spatial scales, societal factors determine the small scale distribution of impacts within our regional case study. In addition to identifying climate change impact hot spots, the structured approach of the impact chain and the methodology of aggregation enable to infer from the results back to the main constituents of vulnerability. Thus, it can provide a basis for decision-makers to set priorities for specific adaptation measures within the complex field of climate change impacts.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CORINE LAND-COVER;CLIMATE-CHANGE;PUBLIC-HEALTH;MORTALITY;TEMPERATURE;WAVE;FRAMEWORK;ISLANDS;DEATHS;CITIES;Humanities;Humanism;Humans,,

Gregory",,English,SPRINGER HEIDELBERG,"TIERGARTENSTRASSE 17, D-69121 HEIDELBERG, GERMANY","This study provides a detailed, process-based life cycle greenhouse gas (GHG) inventory of an ornamental tree production system for urban forestry. The success of large-scale tree planting initiatives for climate protection depends on projects being net sinks for CO2 over their entire life cycle. However, previous assessments of urban tree planting initiatives have not accounted for the inputs required for tree production in nurseries, which include greenhouse systems, irrigation, and fertilization. A GHG inventory of nursery operations for tree production is a necessary step to assess the life cycle benefits or drawbacks of large-scale tree planting activities.        Using surveys, interviews, and life cycle inventory databases, we developed a process-based life cycle inventory of GHG emissions for a large nursery operation in California, USA.        The inventory demonstrated that 4.6 kg of CO2-equivalent is emitted per #5 (nominally a 5-gallon) tree, a common tree size produced by nurseries. Energy use contributed 44% of all CO2-equivalent emissions, of which electricity and propane constituted 78%. Electricity use is dominated by irrigation demands, and propane is used primarily for greenhouse heating. Material inputs constituted the next largest contributor at 36% of emissions; plastic containers contributed just over half of these emissions. Transport emissions accounted for 16% of total nursery GHG emissions. Shipping bamboo stakes from China (43%) and diesel fuel consumed by nursery delivery trucks (33%) were the largest transport emission sources.        GHG emissions from the tree production life stage are 20% to 50% of mean annual CO2 storage rates based on urban tree inventories for three California cities. While considering nursery production alone is insufficient for drawing conclusions about the net climate change benefits of tree planting initiatives, the results demonstrate that nursery production emissions are modest compared with CO2 storage rates during tree life. Identifying key sources of emissions in the nursery tree production system can help operators reduce emissions by targeting so-called hot-spots. In particular, switching to renewable energy sources, capitalizing on energy and water efficiency opportunities, container light-weighting, and sourcing bamboo stakes from producers closer to the point of use are potential avenues for reduced emissions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,ENERGY USE;OPERATIONS;EMISSIONS;IMPACTS;Trees,,

This study covers the whole life cycle of the production process of the playground and its final distribution to the users from a cradle-to-gate perspective. This wooden product was chosen since it is a very representative urban element of the wooden sector in public spaces. To do the assessment, a Galician wood company was analysed in detail. Ten impact categories have been assessed: Abiotic depletion, acidification, eutrophication, global warming, ozone layer depletion, human toxicity, freshwater aquatic ecotoxicity, marine aquatic ecotoxicity, terrestrial ecotoxicity and photochemical oxidant formation. According to the environmental results, the assembling stage is the most important contributor to the environmental profile with contributions higher than 60% to all categories. Both lacquering and energy stages are relevant in terms of ecotoxicity impact categories. In addition, the environmental hot spots were identified in the life cycle: the production of wood based materials (with large contribution to ecotoxicity categories) due to the boards, the production of metals (important contributions to acidification, human toxicity and oxidants formation) and the transport related activities (with remarkable contributions to abiotic depletion, eutrophication and global warming) mainly due to the wooden materials.        Concerning the results from the eco-design, the proposed strategies were evaluated/selected from a technological, economic and social point of view by an interdisciplinary team of researchers and company workers, showing that the strategies with higher viability were: redesign product to reduction of materials used, substitution of aluminum by stainless steel, combination of maritime and road transport for wooden materials, minimisation of the amount of components in the structure and installation area, definition of a protocol for disassembling and use of the product and packaging and, multifunctional and multiuser design. Important reductions (up to 11%) in the environmental profile (normalised index) can be achieved with these alternatives.        The results obtained in this work allow predicting the importance of the selection of raw materials on the environmental burdens associated. Future work will focus on the manufacture of a prototype eco-designed wooden modular playground. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

However recreation managers have limited spatially explicit data on recreation potential around cities, and representative field data are expensive to gather. To support the identification of hot spots for nearby recreation we developed a GIS model based on a representative survey (N=1622). The model was tested for Swiss towns with 10,000-100,000 inhabitants. Respondents indicated (1) outdoor activities, (2) time spent, (3) type of transportation used, (4) preference for given landscape properties, and (5) preferred locations on maps with a cell size of 1 km(2). Generalized linear models were applied to link people's declared presence/absence in the 1 km(2) cells to ""objective"" landscape properties of the same cells. The models explain 41-65% (adj. D-2) of the variance in the data. Many of the ""objective"" landscape characteristics found to significantly influence nearby recreation in the model match with ""subjective"" preferences, i.e. distance to residence, open water, forests, summits with overview and avoidance of major roads. Old people are ""subjectively"" more sensitive to landscape characteristics than young people, and indeed they visited locations with more distinct landscape properties. In contrast, persons reaching their locations by foot are ""subjectively"" more sensitive to landscape characteristics than mobile people (access by car, bicycle), but they go to close-by locations with less distinct landscape characteristics. As most people reach their locations by foot, we conclude that measures to improve green space should be concentrated within 5-10 min walking or biking distance in order to be effective.

The resulting map of pollination benefits identifies hot spots of pollination benefits at sufficient detail to guide political decisions on where to protect pollination services by investing in structural diversity of land use. Additionally, we investigated the vulnerability of the national economies with respect to potential decline of pollination services as the portion of the (agricultural) economy depending on pollination benefits. While the general dependency of the agricultural economy on pollination seems to be stable from 1993 until 2009, we see increases in producer prices for pollination dependent crops, which we interpret as an early warning signal for a conflict between pollination service and other land uses at the global scale. Our spatially explicit analysis of global pollination benefit points to hot spots for the generation of pollination benefits and can serve as a base for further planning of land use, protection sites and agricultural policies for maintaining pollination services.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-USE INTENSITY;ECOSYSTEM SERVICES;CROP POLLINATION;AGRICULTURAL        LANDSCAPES;ECONOMIC RETURNS;NATIVE BEES;BIODIVERSITY;HABITAT;CONSERVATION;MANAGEMENT,,

This study aimed to establish the incidence of shigellosis in an urban zone of Buenos Aires, Argentina, by examining the type of Shigella and living conditions associated with this infection.        Methodology: Between January 2009 and December 2010 we analyzed shigellosis in children admitted to the public health service with bloody diarrhoea from La Plata, the capital of Buenos Aires, Argentina. A total of 372 children under 15 years old with Shigella present in their stool samples were admitted to the study. Variables studied were patient age, type of Shigella, family economic status, and access to sewage services and safe drinking water.        Results: Shigella flexneri was found to be present in 66.8% of the cases. Incidence was 187 cases/year/100,000 children under 15 years old. Cases were mainly observed during the summer (38.5%) in the population of under 5 years old (69.1% of all cases). The risk of shigellosis increased 12 times in those children who lacked safe drinking water and this risk increased 1.5 times in the population without sewage services. Fewer cases of shigellosis were noted in downtown areas, while hot spots were identified in the suburbs. Treating one case of shigellosis has a local cost of US $976 while assuring safe drinking water and sewage services for one family costs US $634.        Conclusion: Incidence of shigellosis in urban areas is associated with quality of water and sewage services. Policies aimed at providing education and improving public utilities networks can help to reduce the incidence of shigellosis.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,Argentina;Epidemiologic Studies,,

The results showed that contaminant tissue burdens at the deployment sites were greater than those of the reference site, and antioxidant enzyme activities were strongly inhibited compared to those of reference organisms. Variations in these biomarker responses were correlated significantly (p < 0.05 or p < 0.01) with the specific metal pollutants at the study sites, but no significant correlations existed between catalase activity responses and the metal contaminants. This suggests the presence of undetermined contaminants or other exposure routes that may be responsible for the decreased catalase activity. Multivariate analysis revealed a causal relationship between contaminants at each deployment site and the biochemical ""response"" of the caged shrimps at these sites and demonstrated the presence of two contaminant ""hot"" spots.

Especially the combination of high temperatures and poor air quality impinges on the well-being of man. This accentuates the need for assessing the health risks of residents regarding air pollutants and anomalously high summer air temperatures. However, comprehensive information on the spatial and temporal distribution of temperature and particulate matter (PM) concentration in cities are presently difficult to obtain since only few measurement sites exist.        In order to identify hot spots with high health risks for distinct groups of urban population, measurement campaigns were carried out, capturing the spatial distribution of temperature and PM concentrations in the City of Aachen, Germany (pop. 245,000).        Several locations were selected to examine spatial influences such as topography, building density, vegetation and traffic on temperature and PM. The findings permit the detection of urban environmental variables that contribute to both temperature enhancement and poor air quality. Those variables were used as spatial predictors for the identification of possible hot spots inside and outside the area of field measurements. The zones of enhanced risks of high air temperature and PM levels were detected by means of GIS based geo-statistic modeling. These areas were mainly identified in the inner city, which is characterized by a dense building structure and heavy traffic.        A chemical characterization of different PM fractions complements the GIS based investigations. The analysis of toxicologically relevant components provides information on air quality at urban, suburban and rural sites. The results of the chemical analyses support the results obtained from geo-statistical modeling. It reveals high concentrations of health relevant airborne species like metals and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons within the zone of enhanced risk for the coincidence of temperature stress and PM pollution.

Coexisting with newly arrived, affluent WUI populations are working class, poor or otherwise socially vulnerable populations. The latter groups typically experience greater losses from environmental disasters such as wildfire because lower income residents are less likely to have established mitigation programs in place to help absorb loss. We use geographically weighted regression to examine spatial variation in the association between social vulnerability (SOVUL) and wildfire risk. In doing so, we identify ""hot spots"" or geographical clusters where SOVUL varies positively with wildfire risk across six Southern states-Alabama, Arkansas, Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, and South Carolina.

While much has been written about parks and crime, little research exists which empirically examines the topic. The current research examines neighborhood parks in Philadelphia, PA as they relate to crime and disorder that occurs outdoors. We use primary data collection to quantify the number of potential activity generators (recreation centers, pools, playground, night lighting, and so on) and other park characteristics.

While chemical changes in urban soils have been well characterized, similar surveys of riparian sediments in urbanized areas are rare. Metal concentrations were measured in sediments collected from riparian areas across the urbanization gradient in Baltimore, MD. Average metal concentrations are similar to those observed in other regional studies. Two important spatial patterns are evident in the data. First, calcium concentrations double across the urbanization gradient, regardless of changes in underlying geochemistry at the boundary between the Eastern US Piedmont and Coastal Plain physiographic provinces. Alkali-earth metal ratios indicate that the additional Ca is very pure and possibly arises from cement common to urban systems. Second, hot spots of trace metals typically associated with urban systems (e.g., Cu, Zn, and Pb) occur in areas that have been artificially filled to create additional real estate in high land value areas. Together, these data indicate that riparian sediments exhibit unexpected patterns of metal contamination. If these sediments are remobilized, during events such as droughts or floods, this contamination may perpetuate legacy impacts to ecosystem health from a history of fluvial contamination.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-USE;STREET SEDIMENTS;TRACE-ELEMENTS;FOREST SOILS;BALTIMORE;MARYLAND;TRENDS;BUDGET;CYCLE;ZINC,,

We have used tracer simulations of aerosols emitted from MPCs worldwide to assess the fractions which are deposited at various distances away from their source location. Considering only source location, prevailing meteorology, and the aerosol size and solubility, we show that fine aerosol particles have a high potential to pollute remote regions. About half of the emitted mass of aerosol tracers with an ambient diameter <= 1.0 mu m is typically deposited in regions more than 1000 km away from the source. Furthermore, using the Koppen-Geiger climate classification to categorize the sources into various climate classes we find substantial differences in the deposition potential between these classes. Tracers originating in arid regions show the largest remote deposition potentials, with values more than doubled compared to the smallest potentials from tracers in tropical regions. Seasonal changes in atmospheric conditions lead to variations in the remote deposition potentials. On average the remote deposition potentials in summer correspond to about 70-80% of the values in winter, with a large spread among the climate classes. For tracers from tropical regions the summer remote deposition values are only about 31% of the winter values, while they are about 95% for tracers from arid regions. Citation: Kunkel, D., M. G.

Study design: Cross-sectional geospatial analysis using routinely collected general practitioner electronic record data.        Sample and setting: Tower Hamlets, an inner-city district of London, UK, characterised by high socioeconomic and ethnic diversity and high prevalence of non-communicable diseases.        Methods: The authors used type 2 diabetes as an example. The data set was drawn from electronic general practice records on all non-diabetic individuals aged 25-79 years in the district (n=163 275). The authors used a validated instrument, QDScore, to calculate 10-year risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Using specialist mapping software (ArcGIS), the authors produced visualisations of how these data varied by lower and middle super output area across the district. The authors enhanced these maps with information on examples of locality-based social determinants of health (population density, fast food outlets and green spaces). Data were piloted as three types of geospatial map (basic, heat and ring). The authors noted practical, technical and information governance challenges involved in producing the maps.        Results: Usable data were obtained on 96.2% of all records. One in 11 adults in our cohort was at 'high risk' of developing type 2 diabetes with a 20% or more 10-year risk. Small-area geospatial mapping illustrated 'hot spots' where up to 17.3% of all adults were at high risk of developing type 2 diabetes. Ring maps allowed visualisation of high risk for type 2 diabetes by locality alongside putative social determinants in the same locality. The task of downloading, cleaning and mapping data from electronic general practice records posed some technical challenges, and judgement was required to group data at an appropriate geographical level. Information governance issues were time consuming and required local and national consultation and agreement.        Conclusions: Producing small-area geospatial maps of diabetes risk calculated from general practice electronic record data across a district-wide population was feasible but not straightforward. Geovisualisation of epidemiological and environmental data, made possible by interdisciplinary links between public health clinicians and human geographers, allows presentation of findings in a way that is both accessible and engaging, hence potentially of value to commissioners and policymakers. Impact studies are needed of how maps of chronic disease risk might be used in public health and urban planning.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,WALES PROSPECTIVE DERIVATION;BUILT ENVIRONMENT;PRIMARY-CARE;ENGLAND;PREVALENCE;VALIDATION;INTERVENTIONS;Chronic Disease;Feasibility Studies,,

For an assessment of bicyclists' exposure to local traffic emissions, a hybrid approach is presented; it combines personal monitoring and a land use regression (LUR) model. Black carbon, a proxy variable for traffic-related air pollution, was measured with an Aethalometer along the predesignated bicycle route in Seattle, Washington, for 10 days, during a.m. and p.m. peak hours (20 sampling campaigns). Descriptive statistics and three-dimensional pollution maps were used to explore temporal variations and to identify pollution hot spots. The LUR model was developed to quantify the influence of spatial covariates on black carbon concentrations along the designated route. The results indicated that the black carbon concentrations fluctuated throughout the sampling periods and showed statistically significant diurnal and monthly patterns. The hot spot analysis suggests that proximity to traffic and other physical environments have important impacts on bicyclists' exposure and demand further investigation on the localized effects of traffic emissions on exposure levels. The LUR model explains 46% of the variations in black carbon concentrations, and significant relationships are found with types of bicycle route facility, wind speed, length of truck routes, and transportation and utility land uses. This research is the first application of the LUR approach in quantifying bicyclists' exposure to air pollution in transport microenvironments. This study provides a rationale for encouraging municipalities to develop effective strategies to mitigate the health risks of exposure to local traffic emissions in complex urban bicycling environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental,Saúde Pública",,PARTICULATE MATTER;DIESEL EXHAUST;HEALTH;MODEL;PARTICLES;ASTHMA;CITY;Washington,,

As a result, the requirement of the scientific community for fast and efficient methods for extracting and analyzing the thermal patterns from a vast volume of acquired data has emerged. The present paper proposes an innovative object-based image analysis procedure to extract thermal patterns for the quantitative analysis of satellite-derived Land Surface Temperature (LST) maps. The spatial and thermal attributes associated with these objects are then calculated and used for the analyses of the intensity, the position and the spatial extent of UHIs. A case study was conducted in the Greater Athens Area, Greece. More than 3000 LST images of the area acquired by MODIS sensor over a decade were analyzed. Three daytime hot-spots were identified and studied (Megara, Elefsina-Aspropyrgos and Mesogeia). They were all found to exhibit similar behavior, gradually increasing their maximum temperature during the summer season and reaching their maxima in mid-July. The hot-spots' thermal intensities compared to a suburban area were of 9-10 degrees C and were found to be highly correlated to their areal extent. During the night-time, Athens center developed a typical UHI spatially coinciding with the dense urban fabric. The nighttime maximum LST peaked (on average) at the end of July, two weeks later than the daytime surface patterns. The mean spatial extent of UHI in Athens was 55.2 km(2), whilst its mean intensity was 5.6 degrees C. The proposed automatic extraction process can be customized for other cities and potentially used for comparison of LST patterns and UHI behavior between different cities. (C) 2011 Elsevier Inc.

This study describes a spatial approach to assess environmental causes of outdoor falls using a small urban community in Hong Kong as an example. The method involves collecting data on fall occurrences and mapping their geographic positions to examine circumstances and environmental evidence that contribute to falls. High risk locations or hot spots of falls are identified on the bases of spatial proximity and concentration of falls within a threshold distance by means of kernel smoothing and standard deviational ellipses. This method of geographic aggregation of individual fall incidents for a small-area study yields hot spots of manageable sizes. The spatial clustering approach is effective in two ways. Firstly, it allows visualisation and isolation of fall hot spots to draw focus. Secondly and especially under conditions of resource decline, policy makers are able to target specific locations to examine the underlying causal mechanisms and strategise effective response and preventive measures based on the types of environmental risk factors identified.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,PUBLIC-HEALTH;SPATIAL-ANALYSIS;OLDER-PEOPLE;COMMUNITY;PREVENTION;POPULATION;PREDICTORS;DISEASE;ADULTS;HOME;Risk Assessment,,

Economic losses below province level have not been systematically analyzed due to lack of data. The objective of this paper is to conduct a TC loss assessment on county level in Fujian Province, coastal SE China, and to break down economic losses from province-scale to smaller administrative units. A unique loss database established by the China Meteorological Administration (CMA) and National Climate Center is used, and four entries at county-level are derived: location of losses due to TC, total economic losses per TC, start time of TC, and end time of TC. Tracks and intensities of TCs from 1949-2008 are derived from the CMA and Shanghai Typhoon Center annual typhoon yearbooks. Physical and economic data are overlaid in a Geographical information System. The landfall spots of TCs on China's mainland coastline from 1949-2008 are determined by generating segments of 1 degrees length. The result shows that Guangdong Province (South China) and Fujian Province (South-East China) host distinct hot spots where TCs make frequent landfall. All TCs making landfall in Central-North Fujian originated from the West North Pacific and none from the South China Sea.        Direct economic losses in 25 counties along Fujian's coastline due to TCs from 1984-2007 are analyzed and corrected with the Consumer Price Index. Some counties report losses frequently at low magnitude but seldom at high magnitude. Others like urban Fuzhou experience losses above 10 million CNY per TC, the most costly one 70 times higher. Other rural counties might experience economic losses far below 10 million CNY when being hit. Landfalling TCs in average cause economic losses of minimum 10 million CNY in 21 of 25 counties. In roughly one third of the counties, economic losses account for more than 30 million CNY when a TC has impact. The average economic losses per TC are 0.2-0.5% of the counties' GDP (South and North of Fujian's coastline) and even more than 0.5% of the GDP in North-East Fujian. The economic impacts of TCs are higher along the southern and northern coastline of Fujian Province where TC landfall activity is higher, but higher economic losses are triggered by higher GDP in these counties. The most costly TCs in Fujian had intensities of Severe Tropical Storm or Typhoon and occurred mostly in the 2000's after making landfall in July. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd and INQUA.

Also, the 5-year plan period (2001-2005) is a half decade of fast regional urban expansion with high population growth within the PRO city clusters, At the same time, the PRO region becomes a leading manufacturing center of the world. Industrial expansion in this region of GD was characterized by the spread of industrial activities from hot spots in GZ city and around Foshan and Dongguan to widely distributed patches of industrial active districts, mostly in the seven newly agglomerate formed and urbanizing prefectural municipalities. To provide transportation communication between GZ city and the municipal cities, a system of highways was built and a region road-network surfaced for the connection of the expanding municipal cities and their sub-urban areas as well as the patches of industrial districts, within their municipalities Also, a network of power plants was built at its periphery. As a result, the ozone precursors, NOx and VOC emission from vehicles, industries and power plants increased region wide, and in particular in the newly formed prefectural municipalities. Hence, the whole region was undergoing a redistribution of O-3 precursors and ozone pollution, following the path of redistribution of population and industrial activity in the Pearl River Delta region of Guangdong.        Study and report on O-3 pollution before 2000 is rare and there were only a few case studies in 2000 and 2004.

Also relevant information on the new dimension of regional urbanization and industrialization for the PRO region of GD, as well as a highly resolved temporal and spatial PRO region NOx and VOC emission inventory surfaced. Thus, 2006 is a good year to procure the regional urbanization and industrial effect, and to produce a snapshot of the regional and area specific ozone pollution in the PRO region of GO. Patterns of annual ozone variation and seasonal ozone diurnal cycles for urban/sub-urban areas, for metropolitan city, for rural areas and for special area in the PRO region of Guangdong are presented for future reference.

The concentrations of 90 molecules which are members of four families of POPs and two families of herbicides were measured within a region of Northern France as part of the French National Soil Monitoring Network (RMQS: Reseal de Mesures de la Qualite des Sols). We also gather information on five covariates (elevation, soil organic carbon content, road density, land cover and population density) which might influence POP concentrations. The study region contains 105 RMQS observation sites arranged on a regular square grid with spacing of 16 km. The observations include hot-spots at sites of POP application, smaller concentrations where POPs have been dispersed and observations less than the limit of quantification (LOQ) where the soil has not been impacted by POPs. Fifty nine of the molecules were detected at less than 50 sites and hence the data were unsuitable for spatial analyses. We represent the variation of the remaining 31 molecules by various linear mixed models which can include fixed effects (i.e. linear relationships between the molecule concentrations and covariates) and spatially correlated random effects. The best model for each molecule is selected by the Akaike Information Criterion. For nine of the molecules, spatial correlation is evident and hence they can potentially be mapped. For four of these molecules, the spatial correlation cannot be wholly explained by fixed effects. It appears that these molecules have been transported away from their application sites and are now dispersed across the study region with the largest concentrations found in a heavily populated depression. More complicated statistical models and sampling designs are required to explain the distribution of the less dispersed molecules. (C) 2011 Elsevier B.V.

In this study, qualitative measures of vulnerability were combined with geospatial data to evaluate the risk to coastal seagrasses at the scale of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR) region (similar to 26,000 km(2)) of Queensland, Australia. The risk assessment outputs identified agricultural, urban and industrial runoff, and urban and port developments as the major anthropogenic activities threatening coastal seagrasses.

There is a distinct discontinuity in threat exposure along the GBR coast with 98% of seagrass meadows in the northern third exposed to only low levels of anthropogenic risk. The clustering of threat exposure is discussed in terms of coastal management policy.

A literature synthesis demonstrates that long-term (e.g.. one-year) average PM2.5 concentrations at a small number of widely-distributed monitoring sites would not show substantial variability, whereas short-term (e.g., 1-h) average measurements with high spatial density would show significant variability. Statistical analyses of ambient monitoring data as a function of wind speed and direction reinforce the significance of regional transport but show evidence of local contributions.

As part of the Lotic Intersite Nitrogen Experiment II (LINX II) we measured denitrification potential in 65 streams spanning eight regions of the US and draining three land-use types. In each stream, potential denitrification rates were measured in common substrate types found across many streams as well as locations unique to particular streams. Overall, habitats from streams draining urban and agricultural land-uses showed higher potential rates of denitrification than reference streams draining native vegetation. This difference among streams was probably driven by higher ambient nitrate concentrations found in urban or agricultural streams. Within streams, sandy habitats and accumulations of fine benthic organic matter contributed more than half of the total denitrification capacity (mg N removed m(-2) h(-1)). A particular rate of potential denitrification per unit area could be achieved either by high activity per unit organic matter or lower activities associated with larger standing stocks of organic matter. We found that both small patches with high rates (hot spots) or more widespread but less active areas (cool matrix) contributed significantly to whole stream denitrification capacity.

Little attention has been paid to geographic variation of cardiovascular prescription use in Taiwan. The main objective was to use local spatial association statistics to test whether or not the cardiovascular medication-prescribing pattern is homogenous across 352 townships in Taiwan.        Methods: The statistical methods used were the global measures of Moran's I and Local Indicators of Spatial Association (LISA). While Moran's I provides information on the overall spatial distribution of the data, LISA provides information on types of spatial association at the local level. LISA statistics can also be used to identify influential locations in spatial association analysis. The major classes of prescription cardiovascular drugs were taken from Taiwan's National Health Insurance Research Database (NHIRD), which has a coverage rate of over 97%. The dosage of each prescription was converted into defined daily doses to measure the consumption of each class of drugs. Data were analyzed with ArcGIS and GeoDa at the township level.        Results: The LISA statistics showed an unusual use of cardiovascular medications in the southern townships with high local variation. Patterns of drug use also showed more low-low spatial clusters (cold spots) than high-high spatial clusters (hot spots), and those low-low associations were clustered in the rural areas.        Conclusions: The cardiovascular drug prescribing patterns were heterogeneous across Taiwan. In particular, a clear pattern of north-south disparity exists. Such spatial clustering helps prioritize the target areas that require better education concerning drug use.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,ACUTE MYOCARDIAL-INFARCTION;URBAN-RURAL DIFFERENCES;CORONARY-HEART-DISEASE;GEOGRAPHIC-VARIATION;INFORMATION-SYSTEMS;RISK-FACTORS;CARE;PHYSICIANS;PREVALENCE;QUALITY;Taiwan;Cardiovascular Agents,,

Much of the problem stems from the types of performance measures used to analyze traffic safety; most conventional safety analyses focus either on crash performance at high crash, 'black spot' locations, or else examine safety at the aggregate scale of the city of metropolitan region. Such approaches not only fail to consider how urban design may influence crash incidence, they fail to provide a framework through which the safety effects of urban design can be understood. Urban design influences the composition and distribution of traffic through a community, establishes locations where different users interact and influences the speeds at which these interactions occur. The effects of such factors are experienced neither at the level of the individual intersection, nor at the level of the region. Such effects are best understood at the level of the individual community. To better account for the effects of urban design on crash incidence, the authors recently sought to develop a geographic information systems (GIS)-based database of crash incidence and urban form for the City of San Antonio, Texas. This article details how GIS may be used to analyze the relationship between urban form and crash incidence at the level of the individual community, including the data sources available for creating such a database, strategies for assembling these data using GIS and opportunities for using such databases to advance professional practice. It is hoped that the methods and techniques detailed in this article will assist planners and urban designers in systematically evaluating the effects of community design on traffic safety.

Resistance is an ecological phenomenon due to potential transmissibility. We investigated spatial and temporal patterns of ciprofloxacin (CIP) population consumption related to E. coli resistance emergence and dissemination in a major Brazilian city. A total of 4,372 urinary tract infection E. coli cases, with 723 CIP resistant, were identified in 2002 from two outpatient centres. Cases were address geocoded in a digital map. Raw CIP consumption data was transformed into usage density in DDDs by CIP selling points influence zones determination. A stochastic model coupled with a Geographical Information System was applied for relating resistance and usage density and for detecting city areas of high/low resistance risk.        Results: E. coli CIP resistant cluster emergence was detected and significantly related to usage density at a level of 5 to 9 CIP DDDs. There were clustered hot-spots and a significant global spatial variation in the residual resistance risk after allowing for usage density.        Conclusions: There were clustered hot-spots and a significant global spatial variation in the residual resistance risk after allowing for usage density. The usage density of 5-9 CIP DDDs per 1,000 inhabitants within the same influence zone was the resistance triggering level.

Rather than being confined to improving prediction accuracy, the concept has expanded to understanding the crash mechanism by using sensor data and devising real-time countermeasures. A major drawback of most studies has been considering a crash as a generic mechanism throughout the expressway. Consequently, proposed countermeasures, such as warning messages, variable speed limits, and ramp metering, have been independent of location. Some studies have incorporated ramps as variables, but little progress has been made in investigating variation in the crash mechanism or evaluating the effectiveness of countermeasures separately for the basic freeway segments and ramp vicinities. This paper divides expressways into five segments: basic freeway, upstream and downstream of exits, and entrance ramps. The paper uses high-resolution detector data and advanced ensemble learning methods such as random forest and classification and regression trees to identify important factors and understand the crash mechanism. The outcome advocates lane-based speed management to improve the safety of basic freeway segments. Although ramp flows were found to contribute to crashes in ramp vicinities, the flows caused little concern for basic freeway segments. The findings will be valuable for researchers in predicting real-time crashes, investigating crash mechanisms, and designing proactive countermeasures.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Black-spot | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Highway",,VARIABLE-SPEED LIMITS;SAFETY;STRATEGIES;FREEWAYS,,

Globally, traffic-related emissions of carbon dioxide are growing rapidly. This paper presents a new method based on a multiple linear regression model to disaggregate traffic-related CO2 emission estimates from the parish-level scale to a 1 x 1 km grid scale. Considering the allocation factors (population density, urban area, income, road density) together, we used a correlation and regression analysis to determine the relationship between these factors and traffic-related CO2 emissions, and developed the best-fit model. The method was applied to downscale the traffic-related CO2 emission values by parish (i.e. county) for the State of Louisiana into 1-km(2) grid cells. In the four highest parishes in traffic-related CO2 emissions, the biggest area that has above average CO2 emissions is found in East Baton Rouge, and the smallest area with no CO2 emissions is also in East Baton Rouge, but Orleans has the most CO2 emissions per unit area. The result reveals that high CO2 emissions are concentrated in dense road network of urban areas with high population density and low CO2 emissions are distributed in rural areas with low population density, sparse road network. The proposed method can be used to identify the emission ""hot spots"" at fine scale and is considered more accurate and less time-consuming than the previous methods. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd.

While this is acceptable for determining a maximum potential exposure or identifying the extent of a risk, there are limitations to this approach when assessing the potential impact of any future abatement strategies or determining the level of exposure outside the vicinity. This paper presents an approach in which representative air quality assessments can be undertaken for an urban area using the minimum number of measurement sites.

The study includes determination of PM10 levels and bulk chemical composition with samples from 17 representative monitoring stations (rural, urban background, traffic hot spot, and urban zones with industrial influence) during 2007. The knowledge of background levels and concentrations of relevant chemical compounds and elements allows the quantification of the main sources of pollution in relevant cities and sites of ecological interest.        In comparison to other stations in Spain and mainland Europe, PM10 in Andalusia is characterized by high levels of crustal matter and secondary inorganic components (SIC). This has been attributed to the following causes: 1) High road traffic and industrial emissions, 2) High frequency of North African air mass outbreaks contributing between 3 and 4 mu g m(-3) in western Andalusia and 4-7 mu g m(-3) in eastern Andalusia, and 3) Climate factors such as low rainfall, dry soils favouring resuspension, and high photochemical activity.        Atmospheric particulate matter in urban areas located in the vicinity of industrial estates is enriched in secondary inorganic compounds and metals. Three main hot spots have been identified according their high trace element concentrations: Huelva (As, Cu, Zn, Se, and Bi), Strait of Gibraltar (V, Ni, Cr, and Co) and Mien (V and Ni). The transport of pollutants from cities and industrial estates to areas of ecological interest (e.g. Donana National Park) has been found to cause the increase in background levels in a number of trace elements (e.g. As) in the air. An important outcome of this study is that geochemical maps of atmospheric matter are a powerful tool for illustrating spatial variation patterns of geochemical components and identifying specific pollution hot spots.

We first identified the major drivers of the river fluxes by regression analyses, then tested the retained models against the past evolutions between 1970 and 2000, and finally applied the models to the MEA scenarios. For nutrients, the considered river data mainly refer to the large rivers for which long-term time series exist (Rhone, Po, Ebro, and Danube). Here, recent trends were principally driven by fertilizer spreads (NO3, PO4), together with urban wastewater releases (PO4). Future trends remain in the envelope of the observed variability during the last 40 years, both for the large rivers and, when extrapolated to the basin scales, also for the entire Mediterranean and Black Sea. At regional scales, however, the budgets considerably change. In the northern parts of the Mediterranean drainage basin, they uniformly tend to decrease, but they may strongly increase in the south and east. Water discharge is examined on a basis of 37 rivers, showing that this parameter is clearly linked to the evolution of climate. Because of the ongoing evolution toward dryer and warmer conditions, we predict a significant trend of decreasing freshwater fluxes for the future, which already started in the past. Regional hot spots for this decrease are the drainage basin of the Alboran Sea and, when also considering the inhabitant specific water fluxes, the basins of the Aegean and north Levantine seas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CLIMATE-CHANGE;NITROGEN;HYDROLOGY;REGION;African Continental Ancestry Group;Food,,

However, these approaches poorly characterize the spatial distribution of emissions and have been shown to underestimate emissions of some pollutants. To quantify the implications of these limitations on exposure assessments, CO, NOX, and HC emissions from diesel transit buses were estimated at 50 m intervals along a bus rapid transit route using a microscale emissions modeling approach. The impacted population around the route was estimated using census, pedestrian count and transit ridership data. Emissions exhibited significant spatial variability. In intervals near major intersections and bus stops, emissions were 1.6-3.0 times higher than average. The coincidence of these emission hot spots and peaks in pedestrian populations resulted in a 20-40% increase in exposure compared to estimates that assumed homogeneous spatial distributions of emissions and/or populations along the route. An additional 19-30% increase in exposure resulted from the underestimate of CO and NOX emissions by macroscale modeling approaches. The results of this study indicate that macroscale modeling approaches underestimate exposure due to poor characterization of the influence of vehicle activity on the spatial distribution of emissions and total emissions.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,PARTICULATE MATTER EMISSIONS;AIR-POLLUTION;CARBON-MONOXIDE;MORTALITY;Urban Population,,

In addition, the hot spots of ambient particulate matter (PM) and their physicochemical characteristics in a highly polluted zone in southern Taiwan were further investigated and compared. The experimental results show that PM10 concentration in the fall was higher than in spring and summer. Moreover, northern monsoons transported suspended particles from the upwind emission sources to the sampling sites, causing an increase in secondary aerosols such as sulfate and nitrate. The contribution of secondary aerosols in rural areas such as Dai-liao and Chao-zhou (32.1% and 29.9%) and suburban areas like Ren-wu and Lin-yuan (28.7% and 29.0%) were higher than those in urban areas such as Hsiao-kang (20.3%). The higher Fe concentration in Hsiao-kang was attributed to PM emission from steel factories (6.9-7.8%). In this study, the organic carbon/elemental carbon (OC/EC) in PM2.5 and PM10 for the five sites were all in the order of Hsiao-kang > Ren-wu > Lin-yuan > Chao-zhou > Da-liao. In fall, farm burns are very common in both Dai-liao and Chao-zhou, and this source contributed approximately 7.3% and 6.3%, respectively, to these results. The seasonal variation of the contribution from vehicle exhausts to PM10 (13.9-27.5%) at Hsiao-kang was always higher than those at other sites, especially in the fall.

To assist wildlife professionals in identifying potential hot spots of interaction and homeowners in evaluating their risk of a backyard encounter, we used the techniques of citizen science to build a landscape model of HCI for suburban residential properties in Westchester County, New York, USA. We distributed surveys via school children (kindergarten to grade 12) as part of a voluntary class assignment, to maximize the number of homeowners participating in our study and to provide learning experiences for students. Of 6,000 surveys distributed to schools, >1,500 students interviewed their parents on whether a coyote had been seen or heard on their property from 2003 to 2006. Although surveys could not be distributed randomly owing to the participatory process of individual schools, we did receive responses from across Westchester County, representing the spectrum from the most rural to the most urban towns. Homeowners who encountered (i.e., seen or heard) a coyote on their property were on average 50% closer to forest, 36% closer to grassland, and 66% farther from medium- to high-intensity development, complementing existing knowledge on urban coyote habitat use. Our model seemed robust in predicting an independent set of coyote observations (r = 0.88). Based on this model, we generated a map describing the probability of HCI that can be used by both wildlife professionals and homeowners. Regarding the former, state wildlife agencies could more precisely target education campaigns on how to live with coyotes where the possibility of HCI was greatest. Homeowners, in turn, could evaluate their own risk and modify behaviors that would make their property less attractive to coyotes. Furthermore, in creating a descriptive model of HCI from citizen-generated data, we demonstrated how citizen science can be a useful exploratory tool, generating a wealth of data over a large geographic area in a short period, especially when the inquest is appropriate to stakeholder participation in data collection.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,ACTIVITY PATTERNS;Humanities;Humanism;Humans;Suburban Population,,

The CAMx model (Comprehensive Air quality Model with eXtensions) was used for simulation over the Po valley air basin with a 10 x 10 km(2) spatial resolution based on Particulate matter emission and meteorological data for the 01/04/2003-31/03/2004 period.        Model results for speciated PM2.5 mass concentration (including nitrate, sulphate, ammonium, elemental carbon and organic matter) are compared to artefact-corrected data from campaigns performed for the city of Milan and its neighbourhoods. Since model results are not concurrent with the available PM2.5 measurements, bootstrapping technique is applied in order to extract from model results restricted warm-season and cold-season data populations suitable for quantitative comparison with measured data.        The model seems able to correctly reproduce the spatial distribution and the local concentration gradients of both PM10 and PM2.5 bulk mass with high concentration levels on the Po valley, increasing around urban areas. However, the comparison with experimental data shows relevant underestimations of PM10 and PM2.5 concentrations, especially at the most polluted urban ""hot spots"", where underestimations rise up to 60% of the actual PM levels. Speciated PM25 results, still in agreement with local composition gradients, point out that PM mass underestimations essentially derive from a 60% underestimation of organic matter (in both seasons) and sulphate (cold season only) concentrations, whereas a rather good agreement is observed for the other chemical species and especially for the ammonium-nitrate system. Such results suggest to better refine emission inventory data, with particular attention to sources like domestic heating wood burning, and to consider that the fine PM formation mechanism forms condensable gaseous precursors, directly emitted in the atmosphere, whose contribution may account for a large part of the missing PM mass in the cold season.

This is due to the massive presence of industrial sites with elevated environmental impact activities along the NW boundary of the city conurbation. The aforementioned activities have effects on the environment and on public health, as a number of epidemiological researches concerning this area reconfirm. The present study is focused on particulate matter as measured by PM10 concentrations at 13 monitoring stations, equipped with analogous instruments based on the Beta absorption technology, either reporting hourly, two-hourly, or daily measurements. Daily estimates of the PM10 concentration surfaces are obtained in order to identify areas of higher concentration (hot spots), possibly related to specific anthropic activities. Preliminary analysis involved addressing several data problems: (1) due to the use of two different validation techniques, a calibration procedure was devised to allow for data comparability; (2) imputation techniques were considered to cope with the large number of missing data, due to both different working periods and occasional malfunctions of PM10 sensors; and (3) reliable weather covariates (wind speed and direction, pressure, temperature, etc.) were obtained and considered within the analysis. Spatiotemporal modelling was addressed by a Bayesian kriging-based model proposed by Le and Zidek (2006) characterized by the use of time varying covariates and a semiparametric covariance structure. Advantages and disadvantages of the model are highlighted and assessed in terms of fit and performance. Estimated daily PM10 concentration surfaces are suitable for the interpretation of time trends and for identifying concentration peaks within the urban area.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"",,

The gun violence drop continued until the early part of the new millennium. Recent advances in criminological research suggest that there is significant clustering of crime in micro places, or ""hot spots,"" that generate a disproportionate amount of criminal events in a city. In this paper, we use growth curve regression models to uncover distinctive developmental trends in gun assault incidents at street segments and intersections in Boston over a 29-year period. We find that Boston gun violence is intensely concentrated at a small number of street segments and intersections rather than spread evenly across the urban landscape between 1980 and 2008. Gun violence trends at these high-activity micro places follow two general trajectories: stable concentrations of gun assaults incidents over time and volatile concentrations of gun assault incidents over time. Micro places with volatile trajectories represent less than 3% of street segments and intersections, generate more than half of all gun violence incidents, and seem to be the primary drivers of overall gun violence trends in Boston. Our findings suggest that the urban gun violence epidemic, and sudden downturn in urban gun violence in the late 1990s, may be best understood by examining highly volatile micro-level trends at a relatively small number of places in urban environments.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,YOUTH VIOLENCE;HOMICIDE TRENDS;HOT-SPOTS;CRIME;TRAJECTORIES;FEAR;MULTILEVEL;EPIDEMIC;POISSON;MODELS;Boston;Violence,,

We used a propagule-pressure framework to delimit establishment hot spots of a hypothetical generalist EFI in six U.S. urban areas: Chicago, Detroit, Houston, Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana, New York-Newark, and Seattle. We assessed how urban tree cover and propagule pressure interact to delimit establishment hot spots and compared the location of these hot spots with actual recent U.S. detections of two EFI: the Asian strain of the gypsy moth, Lymantria dispar (L.) (Lepidoptera: Lymantriidae), and Asian longhorned beetle, Anoplophora glabripennis (Motschulsky) (Coleoptera: Cerambycidae). Using a lattice of 5-km-diameter cells for each urban area, we used the input data (urban tree cover and propagule pressure) to model establishment and Moran's I to delimit hot spots. We used urban population size and the area of commercial-industrial land use as indicators of propagule pressure in the model. Relative establishment of EFI was influenced more by the two propagule pressure indicators than by tree cover. The delimited land use-based hot spots for Los Angeles-Long Beach-Santa Ana and New York-Newark encompassed more of the actual detections of L. dispar and A. glabripennis, respectively, than the population-based hot spots. No significant difference occurred between hot spot types for A. glabripennis detections in the Chicago urban area.

Although dissolved inorganic P (DIP) often constitutes a relatively small fraction of the total P pool in aquatic systems, its bioavailability makes it an important determinant of ecosystem function. Here we describe, apply, evaluate, and interpret an enhanced version of the Global Nutrient Export from Watersheds (NEWS)-DIP model: NEWS-DIP-Half Degree (NEWS-DIP-HD). Improvements to NEWS-DIP-HD over the original NEWS DIP model include (1) the preservation of spatial resolution of input data sets at the 0.5 degree level and (2) explicit downstream routing of water and DIP from half-degree cell to half-degree cell using a global flow-direction representation. NEWS-DIP explains 78% and 62% of the variability in per-basin DIP export (DIP load) for U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) and global stations, respectively, similar to the original NEWS-DIP model and somewhat more than other global models of DIP loading and export. NEWS-DIP-HD output suggests that hot spots for DIP loading tend to occur in urban centers, with the highest per-area rate of DIP loading predicted for the half-degree grid cell containing Tokyo (6366 kg P km(-2) yr(-1)). Furthermore, cities with populations > 100,000 accounted for 35% of global surface water DIP loading while covering less than 2% of global land surface area. NEWS-DIP-HD also indicates that humans supply more DIP to surface waters than natural weathering over the majority (53%) of the Earth's land surface, with a much larger area dominated by DIP point sources than nonpoint sources (52% versus 1% of the global land surface, respectively). NEWS-DIP-HD also suggests that while humans had increased DIP input to surface waters more than fourfold globally by the year 2000, human activities such as dam construction and consumptive water use have somewhat moderated the effect of humans on P transport by preventing (conservatively) 0.35 Tg P yr(-1) (similar to 20% of P inputs to surface waters) from reaching coastal zones globally.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LIMITS PHYTOPLANKTON GROWTH;GULF-OF-MEXICO;MARINE ECOSYSTEMS;CHESAPEAKE BAY;WORLD RIVERS;HUMAN IMPACT;NITROGEN;EUTROPHICATION;PHOSPHATE;TRANSPORT;Phosphorus,,

Factorial Kriging Analysis (FKA) was applied on data collected in a canalized river (Scarpe, France) for that purpose, because this geostatistical technique allows to decompose a given variable into components of different spatial correlations and map them separately. This decomposition is meaningful provided that it can be related to physical phenomena occurring at the identified spatial scales. FKA applied to Cd and Zn concentrations in sediments of the Scarpe rivet proved to be effective, allowing their mapping to be decomposed in a first map related to a short-range spatial correlation corresponding to hot spots interpreted as the impact of industrial and urban inputs located along the canal, and a second map related to a long-range spatial variability associated with long pollutant plumes interpreted as the effect of one major upstream pollutant input.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,CLARK FORK RIVER;HEAVY-METALS;BED SEDIMENTS;STORAGE;BIOAVAILABILITY;CONTAMINATION;SPECIATION;MONTANA;ESTUARY;MINE;Metals;Spatial Analysis,,

The UHI intensity increased to over 10 degrees C, and UHI extent and thermal patch number also increased remarkably. At the same time, UHI was more dominated and fragmented by high-grade thermal patches. In winter these UHI formed several hot spots and areas of significance, distributed along the coastline. This pattern was related to industrial zones and large infrastructure constructed in coastal areas during the rapid course of urbanisation, since both large impervious ground surfaces, large-sized and endothermic factory building roofs were the sources of these hot spots. A similar seasonal analysis was also carried out, which proved that autumn UHI was most intense in Xiamen and the change in season does not change the number of UHI areas of significance.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LAND-COVER;AREA;Hot Temperature,,

This paper discusses one example, where mental maps have been employed in interviews with creative industry workers and the results accumulated in a GIS for visualisation and analysis. This technique extends on participatory and qualitative methods that counteract overtly economic and empiricist techniques regularly employed in creative industry mapping studies. Collating together creative workers' mental maps within a GIS provides a means for exposing 'high traffic' areas - hot spots of creative activity - and other hidden geographies that comprise the 'creative city'. Key spaces, known within creative communities but understood by researchers only anecdotally, can be visualised with a GIS. The methodology was carried out in Darwin, the capital city of Australia's Northern Territory, which has sought to re-imagine itself as a creative city. Results from two mental mapping questions form the focus of this paper: on where 'creative epicentres' and 'spaces of inspiration' exist in Darwin. The former tend to centre on popular suburban sites and inner city spaces while the latter privileges open space and iconic harbourside settings. The differences and similarities between responses to interview questions are best revealed through 3D visualisation. Outputs from this method incorporate vernacular voices into policy-making, and can henceforth inform spatial planning, allowing for the development of more spatially literate creative city policies that reflect creative workers' actual spatial proclivities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Black-spot | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

Nematodes composed of bacterivorous rhabditids and monhysterids were the numerically dominant taxon (>99% of the community). High nematode densities averaging 35,000 ind. per litter bag (6,500 ind g(-1) dwt) indicate their skills for rapid colonization and successful exploitation of the short-lived habitat established on an Arctic beach.

The purpose of this rapid malaria appraisal (RMA) was to provide baseline data about malaria and malaria control in Amazonas.        Methods: The RMA methodology corresponds to a rapid health impact assessment (HIA) as described in the 1999 Gothenburg consensus. In conjunction with the actors of the malaria surveillance system, all useful data and information, which were accessible within a limited time-frame of five visits to Amazonas, were collected, analysed and interpreted.        Results: Mortality from malaria is low (< 1 in 10(5)) and slide positivity rates have stayed at the same level for the last two decades (15% +/- 6% (SD)). Active case detection accounts for ca. 40% of slides taken. The coverage of the censured population with malaria notification points (NPs) has been achieved in recent years. The main parasite is Plasmodium vivax (84% of cases). The proportion of Plasmodium falciparum is on the decline, possibly driven by the introduction of cost-free artemisinin-based combination therapy (ACT) (1988: 33.4%; 2007: 15.4%). Monitoring and documentation is complete, systematic and consistent, but poorly digitalized. Malaria transmission displayed a visible lag behind rainfall in the capital municipality of Atures, but not in the other municipalities. In comparison to reference microscopy, quality of field microscopy and rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs) is suboptimal (kappa < 0.75). Hot spots of malaria risk were seen in some indigenous ethnic groups. Conflicting strategies in respect of training of community health workers (CHW) and the introduction of new diagnostic tools (RDTs) were observed.        Conclusion: Malaria control is possible, even in tropical rain forest areas, if the health system is working adequately. Interventions have to be carefully designed and the features of the particular local Latin American context considered.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Saúde Pública",,PLASMODIUM-FALCIPARUM;URBAN MALARIA;YANOMAMI COMMUNITIES;HEALTH-CARE;AMERINDIANS;RUMA;EPIDEMIOLOGY;TRANSMISSION;PREVALENCE;ANEMIA;Malaria,,

We used spatial patterns of recent amphibian declines in Italy to test hypotheses pertaining to three potential, nonexclusive factors: climate change. habitat alteration, and high levels of incident solar radiation. This study was based on patterns of presence in a geographic grid for 19 species. Grid-squares in which presence had previously been documented, but was not re-confirmed after a specific threshold year, were considered to represent declines. Using a GIS-based approach, we calculated, for each cell, the mean values - or shift in mean values - of different parameters, used as proxies for the three factors. The measures of these parameters were entered as predictors in specific autocovariate models fitted on grid-square status. Our results suggest that while multiple factors have contributed to declines, climate change has been a major cause of population disappearances. We identified a common pattern of disappearances in areas that have been especially affected by climatic shifts. Our findings also strongly suggest that habitat alteration, due mainly to urban land use, has contributed to the decline of several species and that solar irradiation, though probably not a direct cause of mortality, may have been important in association with other stressors. By identifying the most threatened species, geographical hot spots of decline, and the primary causes of decline, our work provides a basis for improving management and setting conservation priorities.

Results show that newly emerging bare lands along the coastal areas and on the remote islands were well vegetated or developed for fishery, and therefore had the significant cooling effect. However, with the rapid expansion of the urbanized and urbaning landscapes, the heating effect of impervious surfaces increased in proportion. Spatial scales showed that the average size of homogeneous patches dominated with the urbanized and urbanizing areas increased remarkably, so did the extent and magnitude of hot spots. Given the growing extent and magnitude of UHI on two dates, dramatic land use and cover change in urban fringes and the major satellite towns significantly exacerbated the UHI effect on regional scale. As a whole, both the extent and magnitude of UHI in Shanghai have undergone a significant increase. Further, the patterns of UHI (as indicated by LSTs) implied the existence of spatial correlation on the small and meso scales. A directional analysis of the Hausdorff-Besicovitch dimension showed that in E-S profile of the city, the spatial dependency of UHI was mainly associated with structural variance. Relatively weak spatial dependency associated with structural variance also existed in the direction of NE-SW. As computed, the structural variation accounted for approximately 50% of the total variation. Therefore, random factors also played the significant role in causing the complexity in patterns of UHI.

Simultaneous measurements of airflow, traffic flow and carbon monoxide concentrations ([CO]) are used to explore the causes of spatial variability in [CO] over a full range of background wind directions. Depending on the roof-top wind direction, evidence of both flow channelling and recirculation regimes were identified from data collected within the main canyon and the intersection. However, at the intersection, the merging of channelled flows from the canyons increased the flow complexity and turbulence intensity. These features, coupled with the close proximity of nearby queuing traffic in several directions, led to the highest overall time-average measured [CO] occurring at the intersection. Within the main street canyon, the data supported the presence of a helical flow regime for oblique roof-top flows, leading to increased [CO] on the canyon leeward side. Predominant wind directions led to some locations having significantly higher diurnal average [CO] due to being mostly on the canyon leeward side during the study period. For all locations, small changes in the background wind direction could cause large changes in the in-street mean wind angle and local turbulence intensity, implying that dispersion mechanisms would be highly sensitive to small changes in above roof flows. During peak traffic flow periods, concentrations within parallel side streets were approximately four times lower than within the main canyon and intersection which has implications for controlling personal exposure. Overall, the results illustrate that pollutant concentrations can be highly spatially variable over even short distances within complex urban geometries, and that synoptic wind patterns, traffic queue location and building topologies all play a role in determining where pollutant hot spots occur.

Besides air, soil and groundwater pollution, pollution of surface water systems is of major concern because they are often (ab)used to export waste of various consistence out of urban areas and become contaminated on varying scales. The Gironde Estuary (southwest France) is affected by various anthropogenic contaminations derived from historic polymetallic pollution mainly due to former mining and ore-treatment and, additionally, from agriculture and urban areas. Although detailed knowledge is available on the impact of mining and anthropogenic activities on the water quality of the Gironde Estuary, almost nothing is known on the urban impact, even though the Garonne Branch which is one tributary of the Gironde system crosses the large urban agglomeration of Bordeaux. The present work links urban geochemistry and estuary research and aims at evaluating the mobility of potentially toxic trace elements (Cd, Cu, Zn, V, Co, Mo, Pb) associated with urban particles under estuarine conditions owing to the particles' role as potential vectors transporting urban pollutants into the estuary. For this, environmentally available fractions of trace elements in representative urban particles (urban dust, road sediment, riverbank sediment, construction materials) from the city of Bordeaux were extracted by natural estuarine waters of varying salinities and compared to commonly applied HNO3 extractions.        For the assessment of the urban particles' contribution to the pollution of the Gironde/Garonne system, various particle types were sampled in Bordeaux: road sediments, urban bulk deposition, construction materials (concrete, asphalt, tile and gravel) and flood sediments. Potentially environmental available fractions of Cd, Cu, Zn, V, Co, Mo and Pb were extracted by means of concentrated HNO3, estuarine freshwaters and waters of two different salinities (S = 15 and S = 31). Analysis of trace elements was carried out by means of quadrupole inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry. Furthermore, single particles from road sediments were characterised with scanning electron microscopy (SEM).        SEM analysis clearly showed that some particles contained fairly high concentrations of potentially toxic trace elements. Extractions of materials investigated by varying acidities and salinities documented that the potentially bioavailable fractions extracted by concentrated HNO3 may cover wide concentration ranges. Natural estuarine waters of various salinities (S = 0.5; S = 15; S = 31) extracted high proportions of Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd from urban particles, especially for high-salinity water (S = 31). Extractions with freshwater revealed the lowest concentrations of desorbed trace elements. Particulate Mo, Pb and V showed similar or lower mobility in saline water compared with freshwater, depending on the sample type.        Trace element mobility in estuarine waters varied according to the type of urban particles and depended on salinity for Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd. This is of high importance for towns located directly at the coast or for cities like Bordeaux, where water courses crossing the agglomerations are connected to saline water masses. Since trace elements desorbed from particles in saline waters may become highly bioavailable, they bear a potential risk for organisms. Comprehensive studies on the behaviour of urban particles in estuarine waters and the related potential environmental impact are still missing.        Saline waters mobilise relatively high amounts of Co, Ni, Cu, Zn and Cd from urban particles suggesting considerable metal fluxes from riverine urban systems into coastal waters. Although estimates of trace metal inputs by urban bulk deposition (urban dust) and other types of urban particles are preliminary for Bordeaux and may bear important uncertainties due to several assumptions and extrapolation to the annual timescale, the orders of magnitude are probably realistic. Thus, these fluxes are not negligible and need (1) further and improved observation and (2) to be taken into account in both mass budgets at the estuary scale and emission control strategies.        New approaches combining geochemical and mineralogical characterisation of single urban particle types help identify their role in metal emission into the environment and develop potential limitation strategies (e.g. the ban of priority pollutants in tyres, etc.). Therefore, prioritisation of urban particle sources in terms of fluxes, reactivity of associated pollutants and feasibility of emission reduction is strongly recommended. Coastal cities should integrate extractions of urban particles with saline water into their environmental monitoring programs owing to the fact that saline conditions might cause efficient desorption of potentially toxic trace elements. In continental cities, winter salting is likely to induce intense mobilisation of metals from road sediments that may then reach the aquatic environment, instead of being retained in runoff decantation reservoirs followed by subsequent disposal/treatment with road sediments. However, also particles from continental cities reach coastal waters via rivers and have to be assessed with respect to trace metal desorption under various salinities. There is a strong need for the quantification of fluxes and for the identification of carrier phases and reactivity of metals exported from urban areas to aquatic systems.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,GARONNE RIVER SYSTEM;HEAVY-METALS;STREET SEDIMENTS;LAND-USE;DISSOLVED MOLYBDENUM;CHEMICAL-COMPOSITION;SOUTHERN-CALIFORNIA;SEASONAL-VARIATIONS;EARLY DIAGENESIS;MERSEY ESTUARY;France,,

River water for anthropogenic use, transportation and recreation is of major importance in all of these countries. Microbiological contamination from faecal pollution by anthropogenic sources is considered to be a crucial problem throughout the Danube River basin. Thus, detailed knowledge on the extent and the origin of microbial pollution is essential for watershed management. The determination of faecal indicator concentrations along the Danube and its major tributaries during two whole-river surveys and 16 permanent stations allowed for the first time to draw a clear picture of the faecal pollution patterns along the whole longitudinal profile of this important international river. By including a variety of environmental variables in statistical analysis, an integrative picture of faecal pollution in the Danube River basin could be evolved. Four hot spots and six stretches of differing faecal pollution were identified, mainly linked with input from large municipalities. Significant decline of microbiological pollution was observed in the upper and lower Danube stretches over the investigation period. In contrast, a significant increase in the middle part was evident. The planned implementation of new wastewater treatment plants and advanced wastewater treatment measures according to the European Union urban wastewater directive will have a great potential to reduce microbial faecal pollution in the Danube and thus improving water quality.

There are two key challenges when considering thermal soaring, the first being the locating of thermals and the second being the extraction of the maximum potential energy from the thermals. Thermal location is by no means an exact science with experienced glider pilots needing to consider many factors to improve the probability of encountering a thermal. As thermals are caused by the uneven heating of the Earth's surface it is, however, possible to predict likely thermal locations. With the application of a suitable guidance algorithm which considers these 'hot spots' it is possible to increase the likelihood of encountering a thermal. Once a thermal is found it is important to attempt to extract the maximum energy from the thermal. To do this the vehicle needs to move quickly to the centre of the thermal. There are many potential techniques for thermal centring, some of which appear to be entirely contradictory to each other, the crucial factor determining the success of such a technique has been found to be the response time of the onboard sensors.

E. and Williams, I. D.",,English,ELSEVIER SCIENCE BV,"PO BOX 211, 1000 AE AMSTERDAM, NETHERLANDS","This research paper explores the role of transience in kerbside recycling performance in Portsmouth, a Southern English city and one of the most densely populated in Europe. Recycling in an urban environment is difficult; UK authorities failing to meet their recycling targets are predominantly cities where medium and high density housing causes problems for collections that rely on householder segregation of waste. Since urban areas are likely to become more densely populated. the waste management issues arising in Portsmouth may be illustrative of those likely to be faced by authorities with high rates of population flux and high population densities in future, especially university towns and cities. A recycling participation survey of 62,299 households was carried out in June-July 2005 and repeated in June-July 2007. Householder participation in the kerbside scheme was recorded over three consecutive collections (6 weeks). There was very little change in overall participation between the two surveys, with 78.4% of households participating in recycling in 2005 and 78.2% in 2007. Although this shows recycling to be the ""normal"" activity, conducted by most households in both surveys, 10% of households were found to be new recyclers"" and 10% seemed to stop recycling (i.e. they were found to be recycling in 2005 but not in 2007), with the more densely populated areas being ""hot spots"" of change. As a consequence, 3 months after the 2007 participation survey, approximately 1300 ""stopped recycling"" households were surveyed by a team of doorsteppers to discuss why they apparently stopped recycling during the survey period. A key issue was population transience, which was found to be greater in urban areas. It seems that once the recycling habit is established it is very difficult to break. Changes in ""physical"" circumstances were the drivers behind those properties that stopped recycling: a change of address, a change in occupants. a bin going missing. A four-group recycling behaviour typology (sustained recycler, non-recycler, stopped recycler, and new recycler) emerges, which will be useful for many urban waste authorities in monitoring and analysing their own recycling performance. It is clear from this study that policies to concentrate population and to increase recycling rates in urban areas could potentially conflict. Actions for increasing recycling rates appropriate for authorities with high rates of population flux and high population densities are suggested, including targeted and carefully timed communications campaigns, especially for university students, and guidelines for new build properties.

We conducted a laboratory aging experiment approximating karst field conditions along with the extensive monitoring of a well-characterized karst spring during December 2002-March 2004 and February-October 2005. The experiment showed that cooler temperatures retarded the expected change in the AC/TC ratio in comparison with warmer conditions analogous to surface water during late spring, summer, and early autumn. A statistically significant decrease in the AC/TC ratio was observed for monitoring data collected during 2005 relative to earlier data. This decrease is presumed to be a result of accidental sewage spills associated with construction in the vicinity of the spring.

This study focuses on outdoor falls within an urban community in Hong Kong. Urban environmental hazards are often place-specific and dependent upon the built features, landscape characteristics, and habitual activities. Therefore, falls must be examined with respect to local situations.        Results: This paper uses spatial analysis methods to map fall occurrences and examine possible environmental attributes of falls in an urban community of Hong Kong. The Nearest neighbour hierarchical (Nnh) and Standard Deviational Ellipse (SDE) techniques can offer additional insights about the circumstances and environmental factors that contribute to falls. The results affirm the multi-factorial nature of falls at specific locations and for selected groups of the population.        Conclusion: The techniques to detect hot spots of falls yield meaningful results that enable the identification of high risk locations. The combined use of descriptive and spatial analyses can be beneficial to policy makers because different preventive measures can be devised based on the types of environmental risk factors identified. The analyses are also important preludes to establishing research hypotheses for more focused studies.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,RISK-FACTORS;ELDERLY-PEOPLE;OLDER-PEOPLE;POPULATION;EPIDEMIOLOGY;PREDICTORS;ADULTS;HOME;MEDICATIONS;HEALTH;Hong Kong,,

Results showed that positive artefacts due to OC adsorption on quartz filters accounted for 39% of the OC measured concentration in Summer, and 23% in winter. Negative artefact due to nitrate volatilisation by the filters was 51% on Teflon and 22% on the quartz filters in summer, and no or negligible losses were observed in winter.

At an urban background site in Helsinki, the daily WHO guideline value (24-h PM(2.5) mean 25 mu g m(-3)) was exceeded during 1-7 LRT episodes per year in 1999-2007. The 24-h mean maximum concentrations varied between 25 and 49 mu g m(-3) during the episodes, which was 3-6 times higher than the local mean concentration (8.7 mu g m(-3)) in 1999-2007. The highest particle concentrations (max. 1-h mean 163 mu g m(-3)) and the longest episodes (max. 9 days) were mainly caused by the emissions from open biomass burning, especially during springs and late-summers in 2002 and 2006. During the period 2001-2007, the satellite remote sensing of active fire hot spots and transport and dispersion modelling of smoke indicated that approximately half of the episodes were caused partly by the emissions from wildfires and/or agricultural waste burning in fields in Eastern Europe, especially in Russia, Belarus and Ukraine. Other episodes were mainly caused by the LRT of ordinary anthropogenic pollutants, e.g. from energy production, traffic, industry and wood combustion. During those 'other episodes', air masses also arrived from Eastern Europe, including Poland. The highest concentrations of biomass-burning tracers, such as monosaccharide anhydrides (levoglucosan + mannosan + galactosan) and K+, were observed during open biomass-burning episodes, but quite high values were also measured during some winter episodes due to wood combustion emissions.

About 30 years ago, it was recognized that the increase in tropospheric ozone from air pollution (NOx, CO and others) is an important greenhouse forcing term. In addition, the recognition of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) on stratospheric ozone and its climate effects linked chemistry and climate strongly. What is less recognized, however, is a comparably major global problem dealing with air pollution. Until about ten years ago, air pollution was thought to be just an urban or a local problem. But new data have revealed that air pollution is transported across continents and ocean basins due to fast long-range transport, resulting in trans-oceanic and trans-continental plumes of atmospheric brown Clouds (ABCs) containing sub micron size particles, i.e., aerosols. ABCs intercept Sunlight by absorbing as well as reflecting it, both of which lead to a large surface dimming. The dimming effect is enhanced further because aerosols may nucleate more cloud droplets, which makes the clouds reflect More solar radiation. The dimming has a Surface cooling effect and decreases evaporation of moisture from the surface, thus slows down the hydrological cycle. On the other hand, absorption of solar radiation by black carbon and some organics increase atmospheric hearing and tend to amplify greenhouse warming of the atmosphere.        ABCs are concentrated in regional and mega-city hot spots. Long-range transport from these hot spots causes widespread plumes over the adjacent oceans. Such a pattern Of regionally concentrated Surface dimming and atmospheric Solar heating, accompanied by widespread dimming over the oceans, gives rise to large regional effects. Only during the last decade, we have begun to comprehend the surprisingly large regional impacts. In S. Asia and N. Africa, the large north-south gradient in the ABC dimming has altered both the north-south gradients in sea Surface temperatures and land-ocean contrast in surface temperatures, which in turn slow down the monsoon circulation and decrease rainfall over the continents. On the other hand, heating by black carbon warms the atmosphere at elevated levels from 2 to 6 kin, where most tropical glaciers are located, thus strengthening the effect of GHGs on retreat of snow packs and glaciers in the Hindu Kush-Himalaya-Tibetan glaciers.        Globally, the surface cooling effect of ABCs may have masked as Much 47% of the global warming by greenhouse gases, with an uncertainty range of 20-80%. This presents a dilemma since efforts to curb air pollution may unmask the ABC cooling effect and enhance the surface warming. Thus efforts to reduce GHGs and air pollution should be done under one common framework. The uncertainties in our understanding of the ABC effects are large, but we are discovering new ways in which human activities are changing the climate and the environment. (C) 2008 Elsevier Ltd.

A total of 129 ambient air samples from 24 background, urban, and industrial sites, including hot spots, were collected to assess a gas-particle partitioning behavior of various persistent organic pollutants.        High volume sampling technique was applied with quartz filters that collect the atmospheric particles and polyurethane foam filters (PUF) that retain the gaseous compounds. Three to ten samples were taken at each site. GFs and PUFs were analyzed separately for their content of polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons.        Gas phase and particle phase concentrations of selected persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in all samples were converted into the particle-bound fractions phi. These fractions were found to be highly variable, but generally highest in Bosnia and Herzegovina due to the elevated levels of total suspended material in ambient air.        Experimental values of particle-associated fraction were compared to the Junge-Pankow model. Interestingly, a model for urban/industrial environments provided a better prediction of partitioning behavior than a model for background and rural background sites. That is probably because the total amount of atmospheric particles is higher in the Balkan region than found in the previously published studies.        Even though it has been stated in previous studies that less than 5% of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are bound to the particles, up to 67% of PCBs were particle associated at several sampling sites in this study. PCB-contaminated soils are probably still one of the strong sources of particles to the atmosphere.        Information on the particle-bound fractions of POPs is important not only for prediction of their fate but also for an estimation of risks they can pose to the environment as well as to humans. When assessing such hazards, it has to be considered that modeled values of the particle-bound fractions can be seriously underestimated at sites with elevated levels of suspended atmospheric matter or at sites with heavily contaminated soils.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,POLYCYCLIC AROMATIC-HYDROCARBONS;POLYCHLORINATED-BIPHENYLS PCBS;GAS/PARTICLE CONCENTRATIONS;PAHS;AIR;ATMOSPHERE;SERBIA;GREECE;URBAN;COEFFICIENTS;War,,

Incident-based congestion is particularly disruptive because of its random occurrence in space and time, which maximises the operational impacts of the congestion on social and economic activities. This paper discusses a method for assessing critical locations-congestion ""hot spots""-in urban road networks, and the development and application of diagnostic tools that will allow urban road system managers to anticipate potential vulnerabilities to incident-related congestion and take proactive action to avoid congestion rather than react to it. The expected Outcomes are then reduced congestion, delays, and pollution; significantly improved performance from the existing urban road system; and reduced pressure to build more roads. The method involves modelling of travel demand, network topology, capacity and road geometry, the identification and assessment of impacts of traffic incidents at specific locations in a road network, and the use of accessibility impact analysis to assess system-wide effects. Accessibility impact analysis is undertaken using an accessibility framework, which can account for time of day, transport mode and destination choices by individuals, and level of traffic congestion among other factors. A case-study application to a specific (potential) incident in a real-world network indicates that the proposed method is feasible and demonstrates its power in identifying not just total impacts but the distribution of those impacts across a region or community. While Current approaches to urban road network planning and management tend to be reactive-finding cures for problems as they arise or addressing locations of recurrent congestion or bad incident record-the vulnerability analysis method described in the paper should lend itself to a proactive approach that can anticipate structural weaknesses and vulnerabilities and help to avoid or at least temper potential adverse effects, rather than to react to them afterwards.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: Interessante | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

However, the spatial distribution of human capital is by nature clustered and tends to be more clustered over the period. The neighborhoods with relatively high level of human capital tend to be localized close to other neighboring areas with high level of human capital. Most of these neighborhoods are located in the southern parts of Seoul, and these spatial clusters, which can be considered as hot spots of human capital, persist throughout the period.

Case studies of three innovative hot spots - Austin (Texas), Oresund (Denmark/Sweden) and Manchester (UK) - suggest that local governments cannot plan urban innovativeness from scratch.

However, the planar KDE may not be suited for characterizing certain point events, such as traffic accidents, which usually occur inside a 1-D linear space, the roadway network. This paper presents a novel network KDE approach to estimating the density of such spatial point events. One key feature of the new approach is that the network space is represented with basic linear units of equal network length, termed lixel (linear pixel), and related network topology. The use of lixel not only facilitates the systematic selection of a set of regularly spaced locations along a network for density estimation, but also makes the practical application of the network KDE feasible by significantly improving the computation efficiency. The approach is implemented in the ESRl ArcGlS environment and tested with the year 2005 traffic accident data and a road network in the Bowling Green, Kentucky area. The test results indicate that the new network KDE is more appropriate than standard planar KDE for density estimation of traffic accidents, since the latter covers space beyond the event context (network space) and is likely to overestimate the density values. The study also investigates the impacts on density calculation from two kernel functions, lixel lengths, and search bandwidths. It is found that the kernel function is least important in structuring the density pattern over network space, whereas the lixel length critically impacts the local variation details of the spatial density pattern. The search bandwidth imposes the highest influence by controlling the smoothness of the spatial pattern, showing local effects at a narrow bandwidth and revealing ""hot spots"" at larger or global scales with a wider bandwidth. More significantly, the idea of representing a linear network by a network system of equal-length lixels may potentially lead the way to developing a suite of other network related spatial analysis and modeling methods.

Using geographic information systems to analyze spatial autocorrelation and ""hot spots"" of industries, we compare the ten most populous metropolitan statistical areas across several ""advanced"" service sectors (professional, management, media, finance, art and culture, engineering and high technology). We find that much of the qualitative evidence on industrial clustering is evocative of broader macro patterns that are both similar and dissimilar across industries and geographies. Our results indicate that there are three spatial typologies of growth in the advanced services within U.S. urban regions. These typologies allow us to intimate qualities of place in general and of places specifically that drive the agglomeration of advanced services.

First, we test whether N export is more a function of (1) processes that affect N concentration in runoff or (2) the propensity of the catchment to convey rainfall as runoff. With data pooled across catchments, the mass of N in export (load) is determined by processes regulating runoff N concentration. There are exceptions when catchments are examined individually, where N load from some catchments is determined by the hydrologic responsiveness of the catchment. Second, we investigate the relationship between N export and catchment features. Loads per catchment area were greater from more impervious catchments, probably because impervious catchments held more N in a mobilizable phase and conveyed more rainfall as overland flow. Loads per area were lower from larger catchments, possibly owing to more N-retention hot spots in larger catchments. Catchments with the greatest N exports were those with commercial land use, and loads decreased as development became less prevalent or as residential replaced industrial land use. Third, we investigated how catchment features moderated direct responses of N export to storms. Export was less correlated with storm features in catchments that were larger, more pervious, and less industrial. Results support an ""N build and flush'' hypothesis, which purports that there is little biotic processing of N deposited to arid, urban surfaces with little organic matter. The rate and duration of deposition determine the size of the mobile N pool. Any amount of rainfall capable of generating overland flow would entrain nearly all mobilizable N and export it from the catchment. Nonetheless, these results suggest that, even with daunting seasonal and interannual variability in storm conditions, material export can be reduced by managing intrinsic catchment features.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,HEADWATER STREAMS;DESERT STREAM;ECOSYSTEM;RETENTION;WATER;BIOGEOCHEMISTRY;TERRESTRIAL;SUCCESSION;EXCHANGE;ARIZONA,,

The Mersey Basin Campaign (MBC) identified Skelmersdale in the north-west of England, and the River Tawd in particular, as a `hot spot' for the dumping of shopping trolleys. In this study, methods for performing litter and shopping trolley surveys were developed. A survey of the River Tawd was performed during 2002, together with snapshot social surveys of local adults and children. Comprehensive yet simple methodologies to quantify and report litter and trolley accumulation over time are reported. The study successfully quantified the litter accumulation and numbers of shopping trolleys in the commercial sector of Skelmersdale and established the views of the local population. Pedestrian litter was the most abundant type identified, with the quantity of litter associating well with the presence of urban features. The shopping trolley survey identified local `hot spots' and established the total number of shopping trolleys along a 1250 m stretch of the river. The first survey in April 2002 found 79 trolleys, which increased to 105 by July 2002.

The presence of shopping trolleys and general refuse in the river presented a negative view of water quality to the public, highlighting the importance of loss of visual amenity as a perceived indicator of pollution. The study also identifies the social and environmental impacts of dumping shopping trolleys in watercourses and explains why physical barriers were the most successful means of reducing the dumping of trolleys.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,England,,

The fates of mineral nitrogen compounds in two bioretention columns (RP1 and RP2) with different media-layering characteristics were investigated under multiple loadings of simulated urban runoff. The immediate capture of nitrogen was evaluated, with nitrogen transformation reactions that occurred during the drying periods between rainfall events. A greater proportion of ammonium was removed from runoff in RP2 (68 +/- 16%), which had a high permeability layer over a lower permeability layer, than in RP1 (12 +/- 6%), which had the inverse configuration. Both column systems demonstrated nitrate export (9 +/- 32% and 54 +/- 22% greater than input for RP1 and RP2, respectively), attributed to washout of nitrate resulting from nitrification processes between runoff loading events. Bioretention media with a less permeable bottom soil layer could form an anoxic/anaerobic zone for promoting nitrification/denitrification processes.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,PHOSPHORUS REMOVAL;WATER RUNOFF;HOT-SPOTS;DENITRIFICATION;SOIL;NITRIFICATION;RETENTION;NITRATE;MEDIA,,

The characterization of the exposure was conducted by means of an extensive literature survey, generating a database with more than 2000 samples. The effects were assessed by the adoption of guidelines previously developed in the literature, because ecotoxicological information about persistent organic pollutants (POPs) in the Mediterranean sediments was lacking. Existing sediment quality guidelines (SQGs) for the target pollutants were compiled and consensus values were calculated for three different categories of toxicity, namely threshold effect concentration (TEC), probable effect concentration (PEC) and extreme effect concentration (EEC). The combination of exposure and effects characterization enabled the identification of some areas of concern in the vicinity of industrial and urban locations and in the mouths of the main Mediterranean rivers. Beyond the Mediterranean continental shelf, the level of toxicity for the benthic community was generally low. The evaluation of the toxicity induced by the mixture of the target pollutants spotted the importance of DDT contamination in the Mediterranean sediments, despite the fact that main inputs to the sea have been significantly reduced during the last decades.

A database of the contamination detected is routinely used as a benchmark against which the contamination detected on seized banknotes can be compared. Evidence presented at court details how banknotes seized from a suspect may differ from banknotes in general circulation in terms of their contamination with controlled drugs. A question arising from such evidence is whether seized banknotes could have become contaminated through being in circulation in drug ""hot spots"". In order to address this issue. a Plackett-Burman experimental design was used to investigate the influence of source location and other factors on banknote contamination with drugs of abuse.        Banknotes were drawn from banks in eight regions throughout the UK. Each location could be described by a unique combination of the factors under investigation, namely whether the location was rural or urban, in the North or South of the UK, and whether it was a port of entry. The socioeconomic class and the proportion of drug offenders in the area and the denomination of the banknotes were also considered as potentially influential factors. Indices were calculated to describe the degree to which samples were contaminated with different drugs, and normal probability plots were used to identify the factors that could account for the contamination observed. Whilst some factors were more influential than others, it was shown that, at the 95% confidence level, none of the proposed factors were significant influences on the contamination.        Cocaine contamination on banknotes has been shown to follow a log-normal distribution. It was, therefore, possible to calculate F- and t-statistics to compare the cocaine contamination on the entire sample set with that detected on a second sample set consisting of banknotes all drawn from a single bank branch. It was shown that both inter-bank samples and intra-bank samples had similar variance and similar contamination levels at the 95% confidence level. This suggests that there are no significant regional trends in the contamination of banknotes with drugs of abuse across the UK. (c) 2006 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.

The matrix identifies and quantifies interactions between all selected variables involved in a system as well as their interaction with the system as a whole. This matrix is used to determine the weightings to apply to spatial datasets within a GIS to develop a pollution vulnerability map. The focus of the paper is to introduce and assess a more versatile coding of the interaction matrix with respect to previously used coding. A case study is presented in which the modified interaction methodology is applied to data for a busy urban location. The resulting vulnerability map, in terms Of Pollution vulnerable hot spots, was compared to a pollution map derived from an advanced dispersion model. The interaction matrix technique with GIs can be used as a tool complementary to sophisticated numerical modelling and has potential as an analytical tool to evaluate multidisciplinary systems.

It examined the contact of individuals with four harmless perflourocarbon tracers ( PFT) released in Midtown Manhattan with approval by city agencies at separate locations, during two types of experiments, completed during each release period. Two continuous 1 h release periods separated by a 1.5 h ventilation time were completed on 3 October 2005. Stationary site and personal exposure measurements were taken during each period, and the first half hour after the release ended. Two types of scripted exposure activities are reported: Outdoor Source Scale, and Outdoor Neighborhood Scale; requiring 1- and 10- min duration samples, respectively. The results showed that exposures were influenced by the surface winds, the urban terrain, and the movements of people and vehicles typical in urban centers. The source scale exposure data indicated that local conditions significantly affected the distribution of each tracer, and consequently the exposures. The highest PFT exposures resulted from interaction of the scripted activities with local surface conditions. The range measured for 1- min exposures were large with measured values exceeding 5000 ppqv ( parts per quadrillion by volume). The neighborhood scale measurements quantified exposures at distances up to seven blocks away from the release points. Generally, but not always, the PFT levels returned quickly to zero indicating that after cessation of the emissions the concentrations decrease rapidly, and reduce the intensity of local exposures. The near source and neighborhood personal exposure route results provided information to establish a baseline for determining how a release could affect both the general public and emergency responders, and evaluate the adequacy of re- entry or exit strategies from a local area.

OBJECTIVES: To detect spatial aggregation of cases, areas of excess incidence and local 'hot spots' of transmission in Montreal. DESIGN: We used residential addresses to geocode active TB cases reported on the Island of Montreal in 1996-2000. After a hot spot analysis suggested two areas of overconcentration, we conducted a spatial scan, with census tracts (population 2500-8000) as the primary unit of analysis and stratification by birthplace. We linked these analyses with genotyping of all available Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates, using IS6110-RFLP and spoligotyping.        RESULTS: We identified four areas of excess incidence among the foreign-born (incidence rate ratios 1.3-4.1, relative to the entire Island) and one such area among the Canadian-born (incidence rate ratio 2.3). There was partial overlap with the two hot spots. Genotyping indicated ongoing transmission among the foreign-born within the largest high-incidence zone. While this zone overlapped the area of high incidence among Canadian-born, genotyping largely excluded transmission between the two groups.

This series of papers examines the potential air quality impacts of this new emission trading program through photochemical modeling of potential trading scenarios; this paper examines the air quality impact of allowing facilities to trade chlorine emission reductions for HRVOC allocations on a reactivity weighted basis. The simulations indicate that trading of anthropogenic chlorine emission reductions for HRVOC allowances at a single facility or between facilities, in general, resulted in improvements in air quality. Decreases in peak 1-h averaged and 8-h averaged ozone concentrations associated with trading chlorine emissions for HRVOC allocations on a Maximum Incremental Reactivity (MIR) basis were up to 0.74 ppb (0.63%) and 0.56 ppb (0.61%), respectively. Air quality metrics based on population exposure decreased by up to 3.3% and 4.1% for 1-h and 8-h averaged concentrations. These changes are small compared to the maximum changes in ozone concentrations due to the VOC emissions from these sources (5-10 ppb for 8-h averages; up to 30 ppb for 1-h averages) and the chlorine emissions from the sources (5-10 ppb for maximum concentrations over wide areas and up to 70 ppb in localized areas).

High-resolution magnetic screening of topsoil in areas of high pollution influx is a useful tool for detection of pollution ""hot spots"". General and regional screening maps with a grid density of 10 or 5 km have been performed on the basis of forest topsoil measurement only. The purpose of this study was to perform high-resolution magnetic screening with different grid densities in both forested and agricultural areas (arable land). Our large study area (ca. 200 km(2)) was located in a relatively more polluted region of the central part of Upper Silesia, and a second (small) one (ca. 100 m(2)) was located in the western part of Upper Silesia, with considerably lower influx of pollution. In the framework of this study, we applied a statistical comparison of data obtained in forested areas and on arable land. The arable soil showed statistically significantly lower kappa values, the result of ""physical dilution"" of the arable layer caused by annual ploughing. Thus arable soils must be avoided during high-resolution field measurement. From semivariograms, it was clear that the spatial correlations in forest topsoil are much stronger than in arable soil, which suggests that a denser measurement grid is required in forested areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,FLY-ASH;SUSCEPTIBILITY;POLLUTION;Dust,,

Consideration of a spatial dimension becomes important where data either refer to specific locations and/or have significant spatial dependence which needs to be considered if meaningful patterns are to emerge. For point event data there are two main groups of approaches to identifying clusters. One stems from the statistical tradition of classification which assigns point events to a spatial segmentation. A popular method is the k-means algorithm. The other broad approach is one which searches for 'hot spots' which can be loosely defined as a localised excess of some incidence rate. Examples of this approach are GAM and kernel density estimation. This paper presents a novel variable resolution approach to 'hot spot' cluster discovery which acts to define spatial concentrations within the point event data. 'Hot spot' centroids are then used to establish additional distance variables and initial cluster centroids for a k-means classification that produces a segmentation, both spatially and by attribute. This dual approach is effective in quickly focusing on rational candidate solutions to the values of k and choice of initial candidate centroids in the k-means clustering. This is demonstrated through the analysis of a business transactions database. The overall dual approach can be used effectively to explore clusters in very large point event data sets.

Methods: Data on pedestrian victims were extracted for a 5-year period (1999-2003) from ambulance services information systems. The locations of crash sites and pedestrian victim density were mapped using a geographic information system. Pedestrian ""black spots"" were defined as sites where there had been at least eight pedestrian victims.        Results: The 22 identified black spots represent only 1% of all city intersections with at least one victim and 4% of all injured pedestrians, whereas 5082 victims were injured at > 3500 different crash sites. The number and population rates of injured pedestrians are greater in central boroughs. Accordingly, the density of pedestrian victims is much higher in central boroughs. Over the 5-year period, in some central boroughs, pedestrian crashes occurred in up to 26% of intersections.        Conclusions: Ambulance information systems were relevant to map pedestrian crash sites. Most pedestrians were injured at locations that would have been missed by the black spot approach.

The relative inattention is notable because of the strong theoretical grounds to anticipate influences that extend both to geographically contiguous areas and to those that, though not contiguous, share similar social characteristics. We argue that such influences-what we term spatial and social proximity effects, respectively-constitute a central feature of community dynamics. To support this argument, we develop and test theoretically derived hypotheses about spatial and social proximity effects of resource deprivation on aggregated and disaggregated homicide counts. Our analyses indicate that local area resource deprivation contributes to violence in socially proximate communities, an effect that, in the case of instrumental homicides, is stronger when such communities are spatially proximate. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for theories focused on community-level social processes and violence, and for policies aimed at reducing crime in disadvantaged areas.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Seguranca Pública",,HOMICIDE RATES;COLLECTIVE EFFICACY;CRIMINAL HOMICIDE;HOT-SPOTS;CRIME;NEIGHBORHOODS;INEQUALITY;NETWORKS;DIFFUSION;SPACE;Violence,,

Simple interpolation of broader level emissions to obtain gridded data may lead to erroneous results. An attempt has been made in this paper to develop a geographical information system (GIS) based methodology for distributing the emissions from a broader level inventory to finely gridded emission values, considering local micro-level details and activity data. Given the importance of Carbon Monoxide emissions in ozone pollution chemistry over India, an emission inventory for CO from various sources for India has been used to demonstrate the GIS-based gridding methodology. The total CO emissions over India for 2001, which are estimated to be around 69.0 Tg year(-1). have been downscaled source-wise (distinguishing between rural and urban bio-fuel, vehicular traffic, coal and biomass burning) from state-level (28 points) to district level (similar to 500 points) before mapping through a GIS utility and finally gridded to a 1 degrees x 1 degrees resolution with a data loss of only about 13%. The final results provide detailed information with emission ""hot spots"" and the relative contribution of various sources.

Several ecological concepts claim that in cities. alien species displace native species. However, several studies show that both species groups increase proportionally. Another view tries to Correlate the high species number in urban areas to the heterogeneity of the urban landscape. This correlation seems to be evident but still needs to be tested.        Most of these findings stem from studies performed on large or intermediate scales using data from official databases. We wanted to confront existing findings and opinions with our study comparing a typical urban with an agricultural landscape section on a local scale.        Our results support the view that plant species richness is higher in cities than in surrounding rural areas, partly because of a high rate of alien species brought into cities by humans.

A farm survey along a gradient through SW Ghana showed that there is only a weak link between the intensification of traditional farming Systems, population pressure, and reduced fallow periods as long as shifting cultivation is possible and common. Even where fallow periods reach a cut-off point, farmers might look for land in remoter areas or invest in off farm activities. Only where market proximity supports the production of high-value crops, investment flows are used to maintain continuous cultivation on favorable production sites, especially those with water access. The results verify the validity of the framework of agricultural-systems dynamics in W Africa, developed by the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture (IITA) and the importance to distinguish between population-driven and market-driven situations.

The data used were collected in Glebe, an inner suburb of Sydney. The approach focuses on the locations of punctual events defining a point pattern, which can be statistically described through local intensity estimates and between-point distance functions. F, G- and K-surfaces of a marked spatial point pattern were described and used to estimate nearest distance functions over a sliding band of quantiles belonging to the marking variable. This provided a continuous view of the point pattern properties as a function of the marking variable. Several random fields were simulated by selecting points from random, clustered or regular point processes and diffusing them. Recognition of the underlying point process using variograms derived from dense sampling was difficult because, structurally, the variograms were very similar. Point-event distance functions were useful complimentary tools that, in most cases, enabled clear recognition of the clustered processes. Spatial sampling quantile point pattern analysis was defined and applied to the Glebe data set. The analysis showed that the highest lead concentrations were strongly clustered. The comparison of this data set with the simulation confidence limits of a Poisson process, a short-radius clustered point process and a geostatistical simulation showed a random process for the third quartile of lead concentrations but strong clustering for the data in the upper quartile. Thus the distribution of topsoil lead concentrations over Glebe may have resulted from several contamination processes, mainly from regular or random processes with large diffusion ranges and short-range clustered processes for the hot spots. Point patterns with the same characteristics as the Glebe experimental pattern could be generated by separate additive geostatistical simulation. Spatial sampling quantile point patterns statistics can, in an easy and accurate way, be used complementarily with geostatistical methods.

These time-resolved measurements resolve the rapid diurnal variation of glyoxal, and indicate the onset of volatile organic compound (VOC) oxidation about 1 hr after sunrise. The atmospheric lifetime of glyoxal is determined to be 1.3 hr for overhead sun conditions. Then elevated glyoxal levels indicate a persistently active VOC chemistry during most of the day. Glyoxal forms from the oxidation of numerous VOCs, which foster the formation of 'photochemical smog' including ozone and aerosol particles; atmospheric levels are essentially unaffected by direct vehicle emissions in Mexico City.

Currently there are no comparative data on extent or levels of species richness for remaining forest fragments. This research identifies landscape metrics and spectral indices that can be applied at the stand and patch level to predict woody-plant species richness in tropical dry forests. This study was undertaken in 18 stands of tropical dry forest with nine sites in the Florida Keys and nine sites within an urban-agricultural matrix in mainland Florida, USA. Woody-plant species richness was quantified at the stand level (belt transects totaling 500 m(2)) and patch level (presence/absence data for 65 native tropical plants less than or equal to2.5 cm dbh) for all study sites. Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper Plus (ETM+) satellite images (pixel resolution 30 x 30 m) were used to assess the utility of landscape metrics (forest patch area, nearest neighbor distance, shape index, boundary complexity) and spectral indices (normalized-difference vegetation index [NDVI] for nine pixels and 500 pixels directly over transects, and all pixels in the forest patch area) for predicting stand- and patch-level species richness. The 18 stands of tropical dry forest sampled in this study included 4248 woody plants, representing 71 species.        Islands in the Florida Keys had higher levels of woody-plant species richness than mainland sites. There was a significant positive relationship between mean NDVI for the nine pixels over each stand and stand species richness and a significant negative relationship between species richness and standard deviation of NDVI for nine pixels over each stand. The density of evergreen plants explained 66% of the variability in mean NDVI. At the patch level, forest patch area and mean NDVI at the stand, 500-pixel, and patch level were all positively associated with patch species richness. However, combining forest patch area with NDVI significantly improved the prediction of patch species richness. Results from this study support the species-energy theory at the level of a forest stand and patch and suggest that a first-order approximation of woody-plant species richness in stands and patches of tropical dry forest is possible in biodiversity hot spots.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,RAIN-FOREST;ENVIRONMENTAL RELATIONS;VEGETATION INDEX;DIVERSITY;PATTERNS;FRAGMENTATION;LANDSCAPE;SCALE;AREA;CLASSIFICATION;Florida,,

Conversely, three dimensional vortices and secondary flows were noticed. resulting in complex flow patterns and pollution hot-spots that proved the important role of CFD in parametric analysis and decision support.

Whilst sustainable drainage systems (SuDS) are available to help combat this diffuse pollution, they are mostly installed in areas of new urban development. However, SuDS must also be installed in existing built areas if diffuse loadings are to be reduced. Advice on where best to locate SuDS within existing built areas is limited, hence a semi-distributed stochastic GIS-model was developed to map small-area basin-wide loadings of 18 key stormwater pollutants. Load maps are combined with information on surface water quality objectives to permit mapping of diffuse pollution hazard to beneficial uses of receiving waters. The model thus aids SuDS planning and strategic management of urban diffuse pollution. The identification of diffuse emission 'hot spots' within a water quality objectives framework is consistent with the 'combined' (risk assessment) approach to pollution control advocated by the EU Water Framework Directive.

We report emission estimates, weather information, surface O-3 monitoring data, and aircraft observations, with a focus on 31 July, the last day of an O-3 episode in which concentrations in Philadelphia reached 165 ppb, the highest level observed there in the past 11 years. As is common in the northeastern states, this O-3 episode started with the development of a broad ridge over the central United States and ended with the northeast corridor under the influence of an Appalachian lee trough with airflow from the SW in an along-corridor direction. For a portion of the morning of 31 July, winds were nearly stagnant, allowing local emissions to accumulate. In contrast to typical O-3 episodes in the northeast, transport on 31 July was limited, and O-3 hot spots occurred close to NOx and volatile organic compound (VOC) emission sources. High O-3 was observed downwind of Baltimore and Philadelphia, both major urban areas. High O-3 was also observed in a less likely region near the Delaware-Pennsylvania border, downwind of Wilmington, Delaware, but near utility and industrial emission sources. Surface O-3 monitoring data and morning aircraft observations show that the residual layer aloft contained 80 - 100 ppb of O-3 but almost no O-3 precursors. Same-day photochemistry on 31 July caused surface O-3 concentrations to increase by 60 - 80 ppb. Photochemical model calculations indicate O-3 production rates in excess of 20 ppb h(-1) in regions with NOx > 5 ppb. High NOx concentrations are a consequence of poor ventilation. Peroxide observations and calculations indicate that O-3 production is VOC limited in the high-NOx portions of the Philadelphia urban plume. Our results are contrasted against a severe O-3 episode that occurred in 1995. While the 1999 episode had stagnation conditions leading to local O-3 hot spots, there were mesoscale meteorological features in 1995 that favored interregional transport.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,NORTHEASTERN UNITED-STATES;STAGNATION EPISODE;SOUTHERN OXIDANTS;O-3        FORMATION;NASHVILLE;URBAN;TENNESSEE;CHEMISTRY;TRANSPORT;HYDROCARBONS;Ozone,,

A condensation particle counter (CPC) and an optical aerosol spectrometer (LAS-X) were installed in a van along with a global positioning system (GPS). Concentrations were measured with high-time resolutions while driving allowing investigations not possible with stationary equipment. In particular, this approach proves to be useful to identify those locations where numbers and mass attain high levels ('hot spots'). In general, concentrations of number and mass of particulate matter increase along with the degree of urbanisation, with number concentration being the more sensitive indicator. The lowest particle numbers and PM1-concentrations are encountered in a coastal and rural area: < 5000 cm(-3) and 6 mug m(-3), respectively. The presence of sea-salt material along the North-Sea coast enhances PM>1-concentrations compared to inland levels. High-particle numbers are encountered on motorways correlating with traffic intensity; the largest average number concentration is measured on the ring motorway around Amsterdam: about 160 000 cm(-3) (traffic intensity 100 000 veh day(-1)). Peak values occur in tunnels where numbers exceed 10(6) cm(-3). Enhanced PM1 levels (i.e. larger than 9 mug m(-3)) exist on motorways, major traffic roads and in tunnels. The concentrations of PMgreater than or equal to1 appear rather uniformly distributed (below 6 mug m(-3) for most observations). On the urban scale, (large) spatial variations in concentration can be explained by varying intensities of traffic and driving patterns. The highest particle numbers are measured while being in traffic congestions or when behind a heavy diesel-driven vehicle (up to 600 X 10(3) cm(-3)). Relatively high numbers are observed during the passages of crossings and, at a decreasing rate, on main roads with much traffic, quiet streets and residential areas with limited traffic. The number concentration exhibits a larger variability than mass: the mass concentration on city roads with much traffic is 12% higher than in a residential area at the edge of the same city while the number of particles changes by a factor of two (due to the presence of the ultrafine particles (aerodynamic diameter < 100 nm)). It is further indicated that people residing at some 100m downwind a major traffic source are exposed to (still) 40% more particles than those living in the urban background areas.

In the course of the European Council Directive on permissible air pollutant limit values, valid starting from 2005 there is an urgent call for action, particularly for fine dust (PM10). Current investigations (Junk & Helbig 2003, Reuter & Baumuller 2003) show that the limit values in certain places in congested areas are exceeded. Only if it is possible to locate these Hot Spots purposeful measures to reduce the ambient air pollution can be conducted. For an efficient identification of these Hot Spots numerical computer models or establishing special measurements networks are too expensive. Using the statistical model STREET 5.0 (KTT 2003) a cost-effective screening of the air pollution situation caused by the traffic can be done.        Methods. STREET is based on the 3-dimensional micro-scale non-hydrostatic flow- and dispersion model MISCAM (Eichhorn 1989). The results of over 100.000 different calculations with MISCAM are stored in a Database and used to calculate the emissions with STREET. In collaboration with the city council of Trier more than 150 streets were investigated, mapped, and calculated. A special urban climate measuring network supplies the necessary meteorological input data about the wind field and precipitation events in the valley of the Moselle. Information about road width and road orientation as well as building density was derived from aerial photographs. Traffic censuses and mobile air pollutants measurements supplied the remaining input data. We calculated the mean annual air pollutant concentrations for NO2, CO, SO2, O-3, benzene as well as PM10.        Results. A comparison of the model results with the values obtained from the stations of the central emission measuring network of Rhineland-Palatinate (ZIMEN, annual report 2002) shows very good agreements. The model was not only used to calculate the annual air pollutant but also for urban planning and management. The absolute level of the air pollutant is mainly dependent on the amount of traffic in the street canyons. Therefore four different case-scenarios with varying quantity of traffic were calculated and interpreted for each street. The results of the calculation show that on the basis of the mean values for both NO, and benzene, it is not to be expected that the limits will be exceeded significantly.        Perspectives. Furthermore the model can be used to find the maximum tolerable numbers of cars for a street without exceeding the air pollutant thresholds.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,PARTICULATE AIR-POLLUTION;DAILY MORTALITY;Germany;Mass Screening,,

Nitrogen (N) loss from agricultural fields and urban areas to stream and groundwaters is a world-wide environmental problem. Excessive nitrogen loading is partly responsible for eutrophication of fresh water and estuarine ecosystems, while elevated nitrate in drinking water has consequences for human health. Under certain conditions, riparian zones improve water quality by removing groundwater nitrate before it enters adjacent stream ecosystems. Nitrate decline along riparian flow paths is most often attributed to denitrification activity and vegetation uptake, but spatio-temporal distributions and rates are notoriously difficult to establish.        2. We used natural delta(15)N techniques in two riparian wetlands with differing vegetation to distinguish between the two processes responsible for reducing nitrate fluxes. We collected groundwater and above-ground vegetation samples along riparian transects where hydrology and groundwater chemistry had been investigated previously.        3. By measuring the natural abundance distribution of nitrogen isotopes in both the groundwater nitrate and riparian plant tissues along the transects, we attempted to determine to what extent the groundwater nitrate decline (from c. 15 to < 1 mg N L-1) observed in these two riparian sites with contrasting vegetation resulted from denitrification and/or plant uptake.        4. Denitrifying bacteria preferentially use the lighter isotope and hence tend to increase delta(15)N-NO3. In most groundwater samples we observed a significant increase of delta(15)N-NO3 (from +5 to +28parts per thousand) as nitrate concentrations declined, which demonstrated that denitrification was predominantly responsible for nitrate retention even when the water table was low.        5. This isotopic approach provided evidence of seasonal variation in the occurrence of denitrification, and helped to delimit the area where denitrification was most active. delta(15)N of overlying vegetation along the riparian transects was higher (from +1.7 to +14.2parts per thousand) than the typical range for terrestrial plants, and was related to the isotopic composition of nitrate in underlying groundwater when the water table was high. Thus, in this case, both plant uptake and denitrification contributed to the observed nitrate decline. However, given that the roots were limited to the upper 50 cm of soil, direct uptake of groundwater nitrate by riparian vegetation was only important when the water table was high.        6. Measurement of delta(15)N in plants may be a simple and powerful means of identifying buffer zones where denitrification is actively processing allochtonous nitrate in riparian ecosystems and their surrounding catchments.        7. Synthesis and applications. The isotopic approach described in this paper is a useful diagnostic tool for easily identifying actual denitrification locations where groundwater nitrate removal is taking place. It should allow investigation at a landscape scale of the spatio-temporal patterns of biogeochemical hot spots where denitrification rates are disproportionately high relative to the surrounding area. This could provide a sound basis for landscape management and restoration in the context of diffuse nitrogen pollution control.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-LABELS: HOT-SPOTS | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,GROUNDWATER NITRATE REMOVAL;AMMONIA DIFFUSION METHOD;NITROGEN        TRANSFORMATIONS;AGRICULTURAL WATERSHEDS;COASTAL-PLAIN;FOREST;STREAM;DYNAMICS;AQUIFER;ZONE;France,,

This current paper aims to assess some of the conflicting empirical evidence in the UK and abroad in order to allow an objective assessment of the policy implications. Section 2 presents an overview of technical and financial characteristics of mainly urban public transport systems, including capital and operating costs of recent light rail, guided bus, bus priority and suburban rail systems. Section 3 explores the evidence on the wider costs and benefits of systems in the UK, including wider environmental and socio-economic impacts. Although more expensive to build (under similar conditions), light rail systems often carry more passengers than 'intermediate' bus-based systems such as guided bus and segregated busways. There is not much between public transport systems on the basis of operating costs per passenger-km, except metro systems, which are twice as expensive to run as bus-based systems. When comparing revenues and operating costs directly, all modes except suburban regional rail appear capable of covering operating costs overall, with light rail and some of London's suburban rail services providing a marginal surplus of revenue. Average speeds of light rail and bus-based systems are comparable. In heavily congested corridors, new light rail systems can reduce journey times significantly, but such reductions are lower for bus-based systems, mainly because of the relatively limited amount of segregated right of way and priority at traffic signals. This highlights the fact that bus priority systems act primarily as 'congestion busters' at hot spots, which can be implemented more flexibly and gradually than for rail-based systems. Currently, electric propulsion appears to be the best option to mitigate air pollution and noise. However, new clean vehicle technologies will soon be in a position to play a major role in reducing emissions, in particular for bus-based systems. In terms of external costs per bus/train-km, environmental costs appear higher than accident costs, but lower than congestion externalities.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Outros",,"",,

Location The city of Brussels.        Methods We considered the relationship between size, species richness and plant functional groups among one very large (1666 ha) and 11 rather small (2-123 ha) woodlots.        Results The largest woodlot harboured species missing in the smaller ones. The species-area relationship plotted for these wooded patches fitted the semilog model very well. Twenty-three species had a significantly higher frequency in the main forest. Only six species had a significantly higher frequency in smaller woodlots. The occurrence of species groups with high conservation value (e.g. ancient forest species, rare species) was higher in large patches. However, a SLOSS analysis showed that habitat subdivision appeared to be associated with increased species counts. A marginally nonsignificant effect of distance to the main forest became significant when matrix species were removed from the patch samples.        Conclusions Although overall the data showed a higher conservation value for large woods, some plant functional groups (e.g. woodland species vs. ancient forest species) responded differently to fragmentation. This illustrates that, for conservation strategies, studies considering the biotic characteristics of remnants should focus on the species number of particular plant functional groups, especially those with high conservation value. Furthermore, matrix species should be removed from the analysis in order not to mask underlying patch size and distance effects.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,SPECIES-AREA-RELATIONSHIPS;NATURE-RESERVE SELECTION;HABITAT        FRAGMENTATION;ISLAND BIOGEOGRAPHY;AGRICULTURAL LANDSCAPE;NORTHWESTERN        GERMANY;CENTRAL LINCOLNSHIRE;INDICATOR VALUES;VASCULAR PLANTS;HOT-SPOTS,,

Methods Data on plant distribution of the German vascular flora available in grid cells covering 5' longitude and 3' latitude (c . 32 km(2) ) were divided into three status groups: native plants, archaeophytes (pre 1500 AD aliens) and neophytes (post 1500 AD aliens). Land use and abiotic data layers were intersected with 125 grid cells comprising the selected area. Using novel landscape ecological methods, we calculated 38 indices of landscape composition and configuration for each grid cell. Principal components analysis (PCA) with a set of 29 selected, low correlated landscape indices was followed by multiple linear regression analysis.        Results PCA reduced 29 indices to eight principal components (PCs) that explained 80% cumulative variance. Multiple linear regression analysis was highly significant and explained 41% to 60% variance in plant species distribution (adjusted R-2 ) with three significant PCs (tested for spatial autocorrelation) expressing moderate to high disturbance levels and high spatial heterogeneity. Comparing the significance of the PCs for the species groups, native plant species richness is most strongly associated with riverine ecosystems, followed by urban ecosystems, and then small-scale rural ecosystems. Archaeophyte and neophyte richness are most strongly associated with urban ecosystems, followed by small-scale rural ecosystems and riverine ecosystems for archaeophytes, and riverine ecosystems and small-scale rural ecosystems for neophytes.        Main conclusions Our overall results suggest that species richness of native and alien plants increases with moderate levels of natural and/or anthropogenic disturbances, coupled with high levels of habitat and structural heterogeneity in urban, riverine, and small-scale rural ecosystems. Despite differences in the order of relevance of PCs for the three plant groups, we conclude that at the regional scale species richness patterns of native plants as well as alien plants are promoted by similar factors.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,LANDSCAPE STRUCTURE;HOT-SPOTS;COMMUNITIES;DIVERSITY;INVASIONS;PATTERNS;BIODIVERSITY;INVASIBILITY;DISTURBANCE;ECOLOGY;Germany;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

The wind direction incident to the canyon, and hence the vortex flow within the canyon, was found to have a large influence on the number concentrations, with values typically 2-10 times greater in perpendicular flow than the estimated inner-urban background. Concentrations were also inversely related to wind speed and directly related to traffic flow. Coarse mode mass concentrations were generally found to follow urban background PM10 concentrations except with a 0-5 mug m(-3) enhancement related to traffic-induced re-suspension within the canyon. A small pollution episode consisting of coarse material re-suspended by high winds was extended in time within the canyon. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

The models can be used to identify factors affecting road safety and in relation to 'black spot' identification and network safety analysis undertaken by local road authorities.        The accident prediction models are based on data from 1036 junctions and 142 km road links in urban areas. Generalised linear modelling techniques were used to relate accident frequencies to explanatory variables.        The estimated accident prediction models for road links were capable of describing more than 60% of the systematic variation ('percentage-explained' value)while the models for junctions had lower values. This indicates that modelling accidents for road links is less complicated than for junctions, probably due to a more uniform accident pattern and a simpler traffic flow exposure or due to lack of adequate explanatory variables for junctions.        Explanatory variables describing road design and road geometry proved to be significant for road link models but less important in junction models. The most powerful variable for all models was motor vehicle traffic flow. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science Ltd.

To anticipate the management of dredged materials in the case of the river Seine basin, the quality of the sediments in the river is checked every 3 years before dredging operations. The river Seine Basin is heavily submitted to pollution pressure from nearby industrial activities and urban expansion of Paris and its region. Here, the micropollutant content of the sediment sampled in 1996, 1999 and 2000 before dredging is discussed compared to regulatory standards. The results indicate that most of the sediment samples from the river Seine basin are lightly to moderately contaminated with organic and inorganic micropollutants (heavy metals, PAH, PCB), which makes the management after dredging easier. This pollution is strongly correlated with the organic matter content and to the fine fraction ( <50 mum) of the sediment. These results can lead to other management options than the ones already used in the river Seine basin: (1) dumping of lightly to moderately polluted sediments in quarries; and (2) physical treatment (sieving, hydrocycloning) of contaminated sediments issued from 'hot spots'.

Residents, especially local youth, were the first to investigate the potential links between high asthma rates and air pollution, particularly from diesel buses and trucks. A youth-led march for clean air and community air monitoring projects drew governmental and media attention to these problems. In 1998, a collaboration of environmental justice, government, and research groups came together to develop a real-time air pollution monitoring system known as AirBeat. This community-based participatory research project was designed to answer community questions about whether there are pollution ""hot spots"" in Roxbury and the degree to which diesel emissions are contributing to health problems. AirBeat measures and reports levels Of PM2.5 (particulate matter with a mass median aerodynamic diameter less than or equal to2.5 mum), ozone, and black carbon on an hourly basis. These data are accessible via a website, telephone hotline, and a flag warning system. AirBeat is successful because community residents and organizations participate as equal partners with an equitable share of funding. The project also promotes a community sense of ownership and pride. Dozens of youth have developed leadership and scientific skills, The media have extensively covered the project as a community victory. The data support the claim that Dudley Square in Roxbury is a hot spot for air pollution.

We conducted a survey of small mammals in selected regions of Guinea to assess the degree to which LV poses a public health risk in that country. A total of 1,616 small mammals, including 956 (59%) Mastomys, were captured from 444 households and seven bush sites. Mastomys made up >90% of the captured animals in the savannah, savannah-forest transition, and forest regions of Guinea, while Mus musculus dominated in coastal and urban sites. Animals were analyzed via enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for LV-specific antigen (blood and spleen homogenate) and IgG antibody (blood only). Virus isolation from spleen homogenates was also performed on a subset of animals. Lassa antibody and antigen were found in 96 (11%) and 46 (5%), respectively, of 884 tested Mastomys. Antibody and antigen were essentially mutually exclusive and showed profiles consistent with vertical transmission of both LV and antibody. LV was isolated only from Mastomys. ELISA antigen constituted an acceptable surrogate for virus isolation, with a sensitivity and specificity when performed on blood of 78% (95% confidence interval: 68-83%) and 98% (95-99%), respectively. The proportion of LV-infected Mastomys per region ranged from 0 to 9% and was highest in the savannah and forest zones.

Prevention and educational programs have helped to curb the rise of syphilis, gonorrhea, non-gonococcal urethritis, chancroid, granuloma inguinale and lymphogranuloma venereum within most of the United States. However, there are still ""hot spots"" in the southern U.S. and in non-Caucasian and urban populations, and these diseases continue to be prevalent in underdeveloped countries. Molluscum contagiosum and condyloma acuminata are increasing throughout the world. Herpes simplex is in the midst of an epidemic, having increased in the United States by 30% in the last 15 years. The failure of preventive programs to halt or reverse these epidemics stems from a combination of factors involving both patients and the medical profession. Patient and sexual partner ignorance, denial and deliberate deception play an important role. However, healthcare professional ignorance and failure to keep a high index of suspicion are also crucial. These issues are compounded by the quick-visit concept propagated by managed care, which dilutes most educational efforts. Teens particularly suffer from the lack of an unhurried discussion of sexual practices, and the sharp rise in STDs in this population reflects failure in the medical system.        This paper will review the classical presentations of the various STDs, and will detail in what ways the coexistence of HIV disease alters clinical appearance and disease progress. Subtle variations in presentations that often lead to misdiagnosis are discussed. Diagnosis and treatment of STDs change rapidly as new developments occur, and the latest recommendations are examined. The ways in which these therapies differ in special need groups such as HIV and pregnancy are specifically detailed. The goal of this review is to arm the clinician with all of the necessary ingredients for timely and accurate diagnosis and treatment, as well as ways to assist the patient in dealing with these difficult topics.

Emissions reduction measures resulting from current national and international policies are likely to deliver significant reductions in emissions of oxides of nitrogen from road traffic in the near future. It is likely that there will still be exceedances of this target value in 2005 and in 2009 if national measures are considered in isolation, particularly at the roadside. It is envisaged that this 'policy gap' will be addressed by implementing local air quality management to reduce concentrations in locations that are at risk of exceeding the objective. Maps of estimated annual mean NO2 concentrations in both urban background and roadside locations are a valuable resource for the development of UK air quality policy and for the identification of locations at which local air quality management measures may be required. Maps of annual mean NO2 concentrations at both background and roadside locations for 1998 have been calculated using modelling methods, which make use of four mathematically straightforward, empirically derived linear relationships. Maps of projected concentrations in 2005 and 2009 have also been calculated using an illustrative emissions scenario. For this emissions scenario, annual mean urban background NO2 concentrations in 2005 are likely to be below 40 mug m(-3), in all areas except for inner London, where current national and international policies are expected to lead to concentrations in the range 40-41 mug m(-3). Reductions in NO, emissions between 2005 and 2009 are expected to reduce background concentrations to the extent that our modelling results indicate that 40 mug m(-3) is unlikely to be exceeded in background locations by 2009. Roadside NO2 concentrations in urban areas in 2005 and 2009 are expected to be significantly higher than in background locations. 21% of urban major road links are expected to have roadside NO2 greater than or equal to 40 mug m(-3) in 2005 for our illustrative emissions scenario. The continuing downward trend in traffic emissions is likely to further reduce the number of links exceeding this value by 2009, with about 6% of urban major road links predicted to have concentrations higher than 40 mug m(-3). The majority of these links are in the London area. The remaining links are generally confined to the most heavily trafficked roads in other big cities. (C) 2001 AEA Technology Plc.

SANDRA E. SHUMWAY, NATURAL SCIENCE DIVISION, SOUTHAMPTON        COLLEGE, SOUTHAMPTON, NY 11968 USA","Baynes Sound, located on the east coast of Vancouver Island in western Canada, is one of the prime shellfish culture areas of British Columbia. In 1994 the Baynes Sound Stewardship Action Group, a multistakeholder group, was formed to address and to remediate nonpoint sources of bacteriological pollution threatening the economic and environmental health of the sound. Remediation action projects for urban stormwater, malfunctioning on-site septic systems, and agricultural runoff have successfully involved hundreds of community volunteers and dozens of financial supporters in simple and effective pollution reduction activities. The community-based ""hot spots"" projects have engaged and educated citizens in actions to improve water quality, in ways government authorities alone could not have done. This work demonstrates that partnerships among government, the shellfish industry, community groups, and citizens can create a powerful means for improving water quality. The projects also show that citizens are capable of creating positive environmental changes in their communities through monitoring, education. and remediation programs. Citizen volunteers can he dedicated and passionate agents of change when provided with the opportunity to participate in creating healthier communities that benefit themselves and a clean-water-dependent industry, such as shellfish culture.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"",,

The source pool for the majority of aliens was Europe and America. Thus, the source pool has a biogeographic bias which explains the low proportion of aliens in the tropics: most species in the European or American source pool are not well adapted to tropical conditions. As expected, native and alien plant species showed an area effect. Correcting for this area effect, species rich zones showed a higher proportion of alien plant species in their flora. At the analysed scale, species richness of native plant communities does not increase the resistance to invasions and alien plant species invade diversity hotspots. Compared to the other ecogeographic zone, the urban area around Nairobi showed an increased richness in alien and native plant species. This is very similar to findings in Europe, although the history of urbanisation is much shorter in Kenya. The species turnover between zones (beta-diversity) shows a similar pattern in native and alien plant species. Within a very short time scale the alien plant species mapped the biogeographic patterns of natives, although the geography of human activities influences the propagule pressure.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,INVASIBILITY;RESISTANCE;INVASIONS;GRASSLAND;INSIGHTS;ISLANDS;Kenya;Emigrants and Immigrants,,

For each sample, the suspended-sediment and water phases were separated and analyzed for 16 polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). The gas station site produced the highest total PAH loading (2.24 g/yr/m(2)), followed by the high-traffic-volume parking lot (5.56 X 10(-2) g/yr/m(2)), the highway off-ramp (5.20 X 10(-2) g/yr/m(2)) and the low-traffic-volume parking lot (3.23 X 10(-2) g/yr/m(2)). In several samples, one or more PAHs were detected in the aqueous phase at concentrations above its aqueous solubility. This result suggests the presence of colloidal-size particles capable of sorbing PAHs to an appreciable extent, or the presence of an oil-and-grease microemulsion. Based on rainfall and PAH data from seven discrete storm events, PAH concentrations were usually highest during the ""first flush"" of storm-water runoff and tapered off rapidly as time progressed. It is apparent from these analyses that storm-water runoff from parking lots, highways, and gas stations is a significant source of PAHs to the environment. Because some of the PAHs are carcinogens or suspected carcinogens, best management practices such as oil/grit separators should be implemented at ""hot spots"" in urban areas to mitigate potential PAH pollution.","RAYYAN-INCLUSION: {""LUCAS""=>""Excluded"", ""Fagner ""=>""Excluded""} | RAYYAN-EXCLUSION-REASONS: Ambiental",,"COLLOID-FACILITATED TRANSPORT;POROUS-MEDIA;CONTAMINANTS;BAY;Hydrocarbons, Aromatic;Hydrocarbons",,
